<p>4. Where an EC Member State or an EFTA State is in difficulties, or is se-<br>riously threatened with difficulties, as regards its balance of payments either<br>as a result of an overall disequilibrium in its balance of payments, or as a<br>result of the type of currency at its disposal, and where such difficulties are<br>liable in particular to jeopardize the functioning of this Agreement, the<br>Contracting Party concerned may take protective measures.</p>

<p>1. The imposition, in respect of transport operations carried out within the<br>territory of the Contracting Parties, of rates and conditions involving any ele-<br>ment of support or protection in the interest of one or more particular under-<br>takings or industries, shall be prohibited unless authorized by the competent<br>authority referred to in Article 50(2).</p>

<p>(a) The EFTA States shall have access to all parts of a programme.</p>
<p>(b) The status of the EFTA States in the committees which assist the EC<br>Commission in the management or development of a Community<br>activity to which EFTA States may be contributing financially by vir-<br>tue of their participation shall take full account of that contribution.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;Decisions by the Community, other than those relating to the gene-<br>ral budget of the Community, which affect directly or indirectly a<br>framework programme, specific programme, project or other ac-<br>tion, in which EFTA States participate by a decision under this Ag-<br>reement, shall be subject to the provisions of Article 79(3).

<p>- to the payment appropriations;</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>entered each year for the Community in the general budget of the Com-<br>munity for each budgetary line corresponding to the activities in question.</p>
<p>The ’proportionality factor’ determining the participation of the EFTA<br>States shall be the sum of the ratios between, on the one hand, the gross<br>domestic product at market prices of each of the EFTA States and, on the<br>other hand, the sum of the gross domestic products at market prices of the<br>EC Member States and of that EFTA State. This factor shall be calculated,<br>for each budgetary year, on the basis of the most recent statistical data.</p>

<p>The contributions to be paid each year by the EFTA States shall be deter-<br>mined on the basis of the payment appropriations.</p>
<p>Commitments entered into by the Community prior to the entry into<br>force, on the basis of this Agreement, of the participation of the EFTA States<br>in the activities in question - as well as the payments which result from this -<br>shall give rise to no contribution on the part of the EFTA States.</p>
<p>(b) The financial contribution of EFTA States deriving from their parti-<br>cipation in certain projects or other activities shall be based on the<br>principle that each Contracting Party shall cover its own costs, with<br>an appropriate contribution which shall be fixed by the EEA Joint<br>Committee to the Community’s overhead costs.</p>
<p>(c) The EEA Joint Committee shall take the necessary decisions con-<br>cerning the contribution of the Contracting Parties to the costs of the<br>activity in question.</p>

<p>Article 88</p>
<p>Without prejudice to provisions of other Parts of this Agreement, the provi-<br>sions of this Part shall not preclude the possibility for any Contracting Party<br>to prepare, adopt and implement measures independently.</p>

<p>1. As soon as new legislation is being drawn up by the EC Commission in a<br>field which is governed by this Agreement, the EC Commission shall infor-<br>mally seek advice from experts of the EFTA States in the same way as it<br>seeks advice from experts of the EC Member States for the elaboration of<br>its proposals.</p>
<p>2. When transmitting its proposal to the Council of the European Communi-<br>ties, the EC Commission shall transmit copies thereof to the EFTA States.</p>
<p>At the request of one of the Contracting Parties, a preliminary exchange<br>of views takes place in the EEA Joint Committee.</p>
<p>3. During the phase preceding the decision of the Council of the European<br>Communities, in a continuous information and consultation process, the<br>Contracting Parties consult each other again in the EEA Joint Committee at<br>the significant moments at the request of one of them.</p>
<p>4. The Contracting Parties shall cooperate in good faith during the informa-<br>tion and consultation phase with a view to facilitating, at the end of the pro-<br>cess, the decision-taking in the EEA Joint Committee.</p>

<p>Article 102</p>
<p>1. In order to guarantee the legal security and the homogeneity of the EEA,<br>the EEA Joint Committee shall take a decision concerning an amendment<br>of an Annex to this Agreement as closely as possible to the adoption by the<br>Community of the corresponding new Community legislation with a view to<br>permitting a simultaneous application of the latter as well as of the amend-<br>ments of the Annexes to the Agreement. To this end, the Community shall,<br>whenever adopting a legislative act on an issue which is governed by this Ag-<br>reement, as soon as possible inform the other Contracting Parties in the<br>EEA Joint Committee.</p>
<p>2. The part of an Annex to this Agreement which would be directly affected<br>by the new legislation is assessed in the EEA Joint Committee.</p>
<p>3. The Contracting Parties shall make all efforts to arrive at an agreement on<br>matters relevant to this Agreement.</p>
<p>The EEA Joint Committee shall, in particular, make every effort to find<br>a mutually acceptable solution where a serious problem arises in any area<br>which, in the EFTA States, falls within the competence of the legislator.</p>
<p>4. If, notwithstanding the application of the preceding paragraph, an agree-<br>ment on an amendment of an Annex to this Agreement cannot be reached,<br>the EEA Joint Committee shall examine all further possibilities to maintain<br>the good functioning of this Agreement and take any decision necessary to<br>this effect, including the possibility to take notice of the equivalence of legis-<br>lation. Such a decision shall be taken at the latest at the expiry of a period of<br>six months from the date of referral to the EEA Joint Committee or, if that<br>date is later, on the date of entry into force of the corresponding Community<br>legislation.</p>
<p>5. If, at the end of the time limit set out in paragraph 4, the EEA Joint Com-<br>mittee has not taken a decision on an amendment of an Annex to this Agree-<br>ment, the affected part thereof, as determined in accordance with paragraph<br>2, is regarded as provisionally suspended, subject to a decision to the cont-<br>rary by the EEA Joint Committee. Such a suspension shall take effect six<br>months after the end of the period referred to in paragraph 4, but in no event<br>earlier than the date on which the corresponding EC act is implemented in<br>the Community. The EEA Joint Committee shall pursue its efforts to agree<br>on a mutually acceptable solution in order for the suspension to be termina-<br>ted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>6. The practical consequences of the suspension referred to in paragraph 5<br>shall be discussed in the EEA Joint Committee. The rights and obligations<br>which individuals and economic operators have already acquired under this<br>Agreement shall remain. The Contracting Parties shall, as appropriate, de-<br>cide on the adjustments necessary due to the suspension.</p>
<p>Article 103</p>
<p>1. If a decision of the EEA Joint Committee can be binding on a Contracting<br>Party only after the fulfilment of constitutional requirements, the decision</p>

<p>Bilaga 15</p>
<p>Main agreement</p>
<p>shall, if a date is contained therein, enter into force on that date, provided<br>that the Contracting Party concerned has notified the other Contracting Par-<br>ties by that date that the constitutional requirements have been fulfilled.</p>
<p>In the absence of such a notification by that date, the decision shall enter<br>into force on the first day of the second month following the last notification.</p>
<p>2. If upon the expiry of a period of six months after the decision of the EEA<br>Joint Committee such a notification has not taken place, the decision of the<br>EEA Joint Committee shall be applied provisionally pending the fulfilment<br>of the constitutional requirements unless a Contracting Party notifies that<br>such a provisional application cannot take place. In the latter case, or if a<br>Contracting Party notifies the non-ratification of a decision of the EEA Joint<br>Committee, the suspension provided for in Article 102 (5) shall take effect<br>one month after such a notification but in no event earlier than the date on<br>which the corresponding EC act is implemented in the Community.</p>
<p>Artide 104</p>
<p>Decisions taken by the EEA Joint Committee in the cases provided for in<br>this Agreement shall, unless otherwise provided for therein, upon their entry<br>into force be binding on the Contracting Parties which shall take the neces-<br>sary steps to ensure their implementation and application.</p>

In case of disagreement between these two bodies with regard to the ac-<br>tion to be taken in relation to a complaint or with regard to the result of<br>the examination, either of the bodies may refer the matter to the EEA Joint<br>Committee which shall deal with it in accordance with Article 111.</p>
<p>Article 110</p>
<p>Decisions under this Agreement by the EFTA Surveillance Authority and<br>the EC Commission which impose a pecuniary obligation on persons other<br>than States, shall be enforceable. The same shall apply to such judgments<br>under this Agreement by the Court of Justice of the European Communities,<br>the Court of First Instance of the European Communities and the EFTA<br>Court.</p>
<p>Enforcement shall be governed by the rules of civil procedure in force in<br>the State in the territory of which it is carried out. The order for its enforce-<br>ment shall be appended to the decision, without other formality than verifi-<br>cation of the authenticity of the decision, by the authority which each Cont-<br>racting Party shall designate for this purpose and shall make known to the<br>other Contracting Parties, the EFTA Surveillance Authority, the EC Com-<br>mission, the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the Court of<br>First Instance of the European Communities and the EFTA Court.</p>
<p>When these formalities have been completed on application by the party<br>concerned, the latter may proceed to enforcement, in accordance with the<br>law of the State in the territory of which enforcement is to be carried out, by<br>bringing the matter directly before the competent authority.</p>
<p>Enforcement may be suspended only by a decision of the Court of Justice<br>of the European Communities, as far as decisions by the EC Commission,<br>the Court of First Instance of the European Communities or the Court of<br>Justice of the European Communities are concerned, or by a decision of the<br>EFTA Court as far as decisions by the EFTA Surveillance Authority or the<br>EFTA Court are concerned.

<p>Subject to the provisions of this Protocol and unless otherwise specified in<br>the Agreement, the provisions of the Agreement shall apply to products lis-<br>ted in Tables I and II.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>PRICE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS</p>
<p>Article 2</p>
<p>General principle of price compensation</p>
<p>1. In order to take account of differences in the cost of the agricultural raw<br>materials used in the manufacture of the products specified in Table I, the<br>Agreement does not preclude the application of price compensation measu-<br>res to these products; that is the levying of variable components upon import<br>and the granting of refunds upon export.</p>
<p>2. If a Contracting Party applies internal measures which reduce the price<br>of raw materials to processing industries, these measures shall be taken into<br>account in the calculation of price compensation amounts.</p>
<p>Article 3</p>
<p>New calculation system</p>
<p>1. Subject to the conditions and specific provisions set out in Artides 4 to 9,<br>the price compensation shall be calculated on the basis of the amounts of raw<br>materials actually used in the manufacture of the product and on the basis of<br>jointly confirmed reference prices.</p>
<p>2. Unless otherwise provided in Article 1 of Appendix 1, the Contracting<br>Parties shall not levy customs duties or other fixed amounts on imported<br>goods which are subject to the system referred to in paragraph 1.</p>
<p>3. The list of raw materials for which each Contracting Party may apply price<br>compensation is established in Appendix 2. The procedure for the amend-<br>ment of the list is established in Appendix 3.</p>

<p>Bilaga 15</p>
<p>Protocol3</p>
<p>Article 4</p>
<p>Declaration of raw materials</p>
<p>1. Whenever, in connection with the importation, a declaration of raw mate-<br>rials used in the production process is submitted to the authorities of the im-<br>porting State, these authorities shall, unless they have reasonable doubt as<br>to the accuracy of the information in the declaration, calculate the variable<br>component in proportion to the net weight of the product presented for clea-<br>rance and the amounts of raw materials indicated in the declaration.</p>
<p>2. Rules concerning the declarations to be used and procedures for their<br>submission are established in Appendix 4.</p>
<p>Article 5</p>
<p>Verification of declarations</p>
<p>1. The Contracting Parties shall assist each other in verifying the accuracy<br>of the declarations.</p>
<p>2. The details of the verification procedure of the declarations are establis-<br>hed in Appendix 5.</p>
<p>Article 6</p>
<p>Reference prices</p>
<p>1. Contracting Parties shall notify to the EEA Joint Committee the prices<br>of raw materials for which price compensation measures are applied. The<br>prices which are notified shall reflect the actual price situation in the territory<br>of the Contracting Party. They shall be the prices normally paid at the Whole-<br>sale or the manufacturing stage by processing industries. If an agricultural<br>raw material is available to the processing industry, or to a part of it, at a<br>price lower than the one otherwise ruling on the domestic market, the notifi-<br>cation shall be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>2. The EEA Joint Committee shall on the basis of the notifications periodi-<br>cally confirm the reference prices to be used in the calculation of price com-<br>pensation amounts.</p>
<p>3. Details of the reference prices to be used, the notification system and the<br>procedures for the confirmation of the reference prices are established in<br>Appendix 6.</p>
<p>Article 7</p>
<p>Coefficients</p>
<p>1. When converting amounts of raw materials concerned into quantities of<br>raw materials for which there is a reference price confirmed, the Contracting<br>Parties shall use agreed coefficients.</p>
<p>2. A list of the coefficients to be applied is provided for in Appendix 7.</p>

<p>Difference between the reference prices</p>
<p>For each of the raw materials concerned, the price compensation amount<br>shall not exceed the difference between the domestic reference price and the<br>lowest of the reference prices in any of the Contracting Parties.</p>
<p>Article 9</p>
<p>Limit to price compensation amounts</p>
<p>A Contracting Party shall not levy on a product coming from another Cont-<br>racting Party variable price compensation components higher than the cus-<br>toms duty or fixed amount which it applied on 1 January 1992 to the product<br>concerned when coming from the Contracting Party in question. This limit<br>also applies when the customs duty or fixed amount was administered<br>through a tariff quota, but not in cases where, in addition to the customs duty<br>or fixed amount, the product concerned was subject to a price compensation<br>measure on 1 January 1992.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h1>TITLE II</h1>
<h2>DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF “ORIGINATING<br>PRODUCTS”</h2>
<p>Article 2</p>
<p>Origin criteria</p>
<p>1. A product shall be considered to be originating in the EEA within the<br>meaning of this Agreement if it has been either wholly obtained or suffi-<br>ciently worked or processed in the EEA. For this purpose, the territories of<br>the Contracting Parties, including the territorial waters, to which this Agree-<br>ment applies, shall be considered as a single territory.</p>
<p>2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the territory of the Republic of Austria<br>shall, until 1 January 1997, be excluded from that of the EEA for the purpose<br>of determining the origin of the products referred to in Appendix VIII and<br>such products shall only be considered to be originating in the EEA if they<br>have been either wholly obtained or sufficiently worked or processed in the<br>territories of the other Contracting Parties.</p>
<p>3. The products referred to in Appendix VII shall be temporarily excluded<br>from the scope of application of this Protocol. Nevertheless, the provisions<br>in Titles IV to VI shall apply mutatis mutandis to these products.</p>
<p>Article 3</p>
<p>Wholly obtained products</p>
<p>1. The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in the EEA:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;mineral products extracted from its soil or from its seabed;</p>
<p>(b) vegetable products harvested therein;</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;live animals born and raised therein;</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;products from live animals raised therein;</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted therein;</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside<br>the territorial waters of the Contracting Parties by their vessels;</p>
<p>(g) &nbsp;products made aboard factory ships of the Contracting Parties exclu-<br>sively from products referred to in subparagraph (f);</p>
<p>(h) &nbsp;used artides collected there fit only for the recovery of raw mate-<br>rials, including used tyres fit only for retreading or for use as waste;</p>
<p>(i) &nbsp;waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted<br>therein;</p>
<p>Q) goods produced there exclusively from the products specified in sub-<br>paragraphs (a) to (i).</p>
<p>2. The terms “their vessels” and “factory ships of the Contracting Parties” in<br>paragraphs l(f) and (g) shall apply only to vessels and factory ships:</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 15</p>
<p>Protocol4</p>
<p>(a) which are registered or recorded in an EC Member State or an<br>EFTA State;</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>(b) which sail under the flag of an EC Member State or an EFTA State;</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;which are owned to an extent of at least 50 per cent by nationals of</p>
<p>EC Member States or EFTA States, or by a company with its head<br>Office in one of these States, of which the manager or managers,<br>Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Supervisory Board, and<br>the majority of the members of such boards are nationals of EC<br>Member States or EFTA States and of which, in addition, in the case<br>of partnerships or limited companies, at least half the Capital belongs<br>to those States or to public bodies or nationals of the said States;</p>
<p>(d) of which the master and officers are nationals of EC Member States<br>or EFTA States; and</p>
<p>(e) of which at least 75 per cent of the crew are nationals of EC Member<br>States or EFTA States.</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 15</p>
<p>Protocol4</p>
<p>Article 4</p>
<p>Sufficiently worked or processed products</p>
<p>1. For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained in<br>the EEA are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed there when<br>the conditions set out in the list in Appendix II are fulfilled.</p>
<p>These conditions indicate, for all products covered by the Agreement, the<br>working or processing which must be carried out on the non-originating ma-<br>terials used in the manufacture of these products, and apply only in relation<br>to such materials. Accordingly, it follows that if a product, which has acqui-<br>red originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list for that<br>product, is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions appli-<br>cable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no<br>account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been<br>used in its manufacture.</p>
<p>2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 and except as provided in Article 11(4), non-<br>originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list for<br>a given product, should not be used in the manufacture of this product may<br>nevertheless be used, provided that:</p>
<p>(a) their total value does not exceed 10 per cent of the ex-works price<br>of the product;</p>
<p>(b) where, in the list, one or several percentages are given for the maxi-<br>mum value of non-originating materials, such percentages are not<br>exceeded through the application of this paragraph.</p>
<p>This paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63<br>of the Harmonized System.</p>
<p>3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply except as provided in Article 5.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>Article 5</p>
<p>Insufficient working or processing operations</p>
<p>1. The following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or<br>processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the<br>requirements of Article 4 are satisfied:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;operations to ensure the preservation of products in good condition<br>during transport and storage (ventilation, spreading out, drying,<br>chilling, placing in salt, sulphur dioxide or other aqueous Solutions,<br>removal of damaged parts, and like operations);</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;simple operations consisting of removal of dust, sifting or screening,<br>sorting, classifying, matching (including the making-up of sets of ar-<br>tides), washing, painting, cutting up;</p>

<p>Article 6</p>
<p>Unit of qualification</p>
<p>1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol<br>shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when de-<br>termining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonized System.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it follows that:</p>
<p>(a) when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classi-<br>fied under the terms of the Harmonized System in a single heading,<br>the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;</p>
<p>(b) when a consignment consists of a number of identical products clas-<br>sified under the same heading of the Harmonized System, each pro-<br>duct must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this<br>Protocol.</p>

<p>Article 7</p>
<p>Accessories, spare parts and tools</p>
<p>Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment,<br>machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and<br>included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be<br>regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle<br>in question.</p>
<p>Article 8</p>
<p>Sets</p>
<p>Sets, as defined in general rule 3 of the Harmonized System, shall be regar-<br>ded as originating when all component products are originating. Neverthe-<br>less, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the<br>set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the<br>non-originating products does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price<br>of the set.</p>
<p>Article 9</p>
<p>Neutral elements</p>
<p>In order to determine whether a product originates in the EEA, it shall not<br>be necessary to establish whether the energy, plant and equipment as well as<br>machines and tools used to obtain such product, or whether any goods, used<br>in the course of production which do not enter and which were not intended<br>to enter into the final composition of the product, are originating or not.</p>
<h1>TITLE III</h1>
<h2>TERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<p>Article 10</p>
<p>Principle of territoriality</p>
<p>The conditions set out in Title II relative to the acquisition of originating<br>status must be fulfilled without interruption in the EEA. For this purpose,<br>the acquisition of originating status shall be considered as interrupted when<br>goods which have undergone working or processing in the EEA have left the<br>EEA whether or not operations have been carried out outside this territory,<br>except as provided in Artides 11 and 12.</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 15</p>
<p>Protocol4</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>Article 11</p>
<p>Working or processing carried out outside the EEA</p>
<p>1. The acquisition of originating status under the conditions set out in Title<br>II shall not be affected by working or processing carried out outside the EEA<br>on materials exported from the EEA and subsequently reimported there,<br>provided that:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;the said materials are wholly obtained in the EEA or have under-<br>gone there working or processing going beyond the insufficient ope-<br>rations listed in Article 5 prior to their exportation outside the EEA;<br>and</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities<br>that:</p>
<p>(i) the reimported goods result from the working or processing of<br>the exported materials; and</p>
<p>(ii) the total added value acquired outside the EEA through the ap-<br>plication of this Article does not exceed 10 per cent of the ex-<br>works price of the final product for which originating status is<br>claimed.</p>
<p>2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the conditions set out in Title II relative<br>to the acquisition of originating status shall not apply in respect of working<br>or processing carried out outside the EEA. Nevertheless, where, in the list<br>in Appendix II, a rule giving the maximum value of all the non-originating<br>materials used is applied in determining the originating status of the final<br>product concerned, the total value of the non-originating materials used in<br>the EEA and the total added value acquired outside the EEA through the<br>application of this Article taken together shall not exceed the percentage gi-<br>ven.</p>
<p>3. For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, “total added value” shall mean all<br>costs accumulated outside the EEA, including all the value of the materials<br>added there.</p>
<p>4. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to products which do not fulfil the con-<br>ditions set out in the list in Appendix II and which can only be considered as<br>sufficiently worked or processed as a result of the application of the general<br>tolerance in Article 4 (2).</p>
<p>5. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50<br>to 63 of the Harmonized System.</p>
<p>Article 12</p>
<p>Reimportation of goods</p>
<p>Goods exported from one of the Contracting Parties to a third country and<br>subsequently returned, shall be considered as never having left the EEA if<br>it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 15</p>
<p>Protocol 4</p>
<p>(a) the goods returned are the same goods as those exported; and</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>(b) they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to<br>preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being<br>exported.</p>

<p>1. The preferential treatment provided for under the Agreement applies<br>only to products, satisfying the requirements of this Protocol, which are tran-<br>sported within the EEA. However, products constituting one single consign-<br>ment may be transported through territories other than that of the EEA,<br>with, should the occasion arise, trans-shipment or temporary warehousing in<br>such territories, provided that the products have remained under the surveil-<br>lance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or of warehousing<br>and that they have not undergone operations other than unloading, reloa-<br>ding or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.</p>
<p>2. Evidence that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 have been fulfilled<br>shall be supplied to the customs authorities of the importing country by the<br>production of:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;a through bill of lading issued in the exporting country covering the<br>passage through the country of transit; or</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;a certificate issued by the customs authorities of the country of tran-<br>sit:</p>
<p>(i) &nbsp;giving an exact description of the products;</p>
<p>(ii) stating the dates of unloading and reloading of the products<br>and, where applicable, the names of the ships used; and</p>
<p>(iii) certifying the conditions under which the products remained in<br>the transit country; or</p>
<p>(c) failing these, any substantiating documents.</p>
<p>Article 14</p>
<p>Exhibitions</p>
<p>1. Products sent from one of the Contracting Parties for exhibition in a third<br>country and sold after the exhibition for importation in another Contracting<br>Party shall benefit on importation from the provisions of the Agreement on<br>condition that the products meet the requirements of this Protocol entitling<br>them to be recognized as originating in the EEA and provided that it is<br>shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:</p>
<p>(a) an exporter has consigned these products from one of the Contrac-<br>ting Parties to the country in which the exhibition is held and has<br>exhibited them there;</p>
<p>(b) the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that expor-<br>ter to a person in another Contracting Party;</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;the products have been consigned during the exhibition or immedia-<br>tely thereafter to the latter Contracting Party in the State in which<br>they were sent for exhibition; and</p>
<p>(d) the products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition,<br>been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibi-<br>tion.</p>
<p>2. A proof of origin must be issued or made out in accordance with the provi-<br>sions of Title V and submitted to the customs authorities of the importing<br>country in the normal manner. The name and address of the exhibition must<br>be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of<br>the nature of the products and the conditions under which they have been<br>exhibited may be required.</p>
<p>3. Paragraph 1 shall apply to any trade, industrial, agricultural or crafts exhi-<br>bition, fair or similar public show or display which is not organized for pri-<br>vate purposes in shops or business premises with a view to the sale of foreign<br>products, and during which the products remain under customs control.</p>

<p>Prohibition of drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties</p>
<p>1. Non-originating materials used in the manufacture of products originating<br>in the EEA within the meaning of this Protocol for which a proof of origin<br>is issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V shall not<br>be subject in any of the Contracting Parties to drawback of, or exemption<br>from, customs duties of whatever kind.</p>
<p>2. The prohibition in paragraph 1 shall apply to any arrangement for refund,<br>remission or non-payment, partial or complete, of customs duties or charges<br>having an equivalent effect, applicable in any of the Contracting Parties to<br>materials used in the manufacture, where such refund, remission or non-pay-<br>ment applies, expressly or in effect, when products obtained from the said<br>materials are exported and not when they are retained for home use in this<br>Contracting Party.</p>
<p>3. The exporter of products covered by a proof of origin shall be prepared to<br>submit at any time, upon request from the customs authorities, all appro-<br>priate documents proving that no drawback has been obtained in respect of<br>the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the products con-<br>cerned and that all customs duties or charges having equivalent effect appli-<br>cable to such materials have actually been paid.</p>
<p>4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 shall also apply in respect of packaging<br>within the meaning of Article 6(2), accessories, spare parts and tools within<br>the meaning of Article 7 and products in a set within the meaning of Article<br>8 when such items are non-originating.</p>

<p>2. Movement certificates EUR.l and invoice declarations which are submit-<br>ted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the final date<br>for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of<br>applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these docu-<br>ments by the final date set is due to reasons of force majeure or exceptional<br>circumstances.</p>

<p>Supplier’s declaration</p>
<p>1. When a movement certificate EUR.l is issued, or an invoice declaration<br>is made out, in one of the Contracting Parties for originating products, in the<br>manufacture of which goods coming from other Contracting Parties which<br>have undergone working or processing in the EEA without having obtained<br>preferential originating status have been used, account shall be taken of sup-<br>plier’s declarations given for these goods in accordance with this Article.</p>
<p>2. The supplier’s declaration referred to in paragraph 1 shall serve as the evi-<br>dence of the working or processing undergone in the EEA by the goods con-<br>cerned for the purpose of determining whether the products in the manufac-<br>ture of which these goods are used, can be considered as products originating<br>in the EEA and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.</p>
<p>3.

<p>4. Where a supplier regularly supplies a particular customer with goods for<br>which the working or processing undergone in the EEA is expected to re-<br>main constant for considerable periods of time, he may provide a single sup-<br>plier’s declaration to cover subsequent consignments of those goods, herei-<br>nafter referred to as a “long-term supplier’s declaration”.</p>

<p>Protocol4</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>A long-term supplier’s declaration may normally be valid for a period of<br>up to one year from the date of making out the declaration. The customs<br>authorities of the country where the declaration is made out lay down the<br>conditions under which longer periods may .be used.</p>
<p>The long-term supplier’s declaration shall be made out by the supplier in<br>the form prescribed in Appendix VI, and shall describe the goods concerned<br>in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified. It shall be provided to the<br>customer concerned before supplying him with the first consignment of<br>goods covered by this declaration or together with his first consignment.</p>
<p>The supplier shall inform his customer immediately if the long-term sup-<br>plier’s declaration is no longer applicable to the goods supplied.</p>
<p>5. The supplier’s declaration referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be typed<br>or printed using one of the languages in which the Agreement is drawn up,<br>in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the country where<br>it is made out, and shall bear the original signature of the supplier in manusc-<br>ript. The declaration may also be handwritten; in such a case, it shall be writ-<br>ten in ink in printed characters.</p>

<p>Article 30</p>
<p>Discrepancies and formal errors</p>
<p>1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in a<br>movement certificate EUR.l, or in an invoice declaration and those made<br>in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying<br>out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the<br>movement certificate EUR.l, or the invoice declaration null and void if it is<br>duly established that this document does correspond to the products submit-<br>ted.</p>

<p>2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a movement certificate<br>EUR.l, an invoice declaration or a supplier’s declaration should not cause<br>this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts<br>concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document.</p>
<p>Article 31</p>
<p>Amounts expressed in ECU</p>
<p>1. Amounts in the national currency of the exporting country equivalent to<br>the amounts expressed in ECU shall be fixed by the exporting country and<br>communicated to the other Contracting Parties.</p>
<p>When the amounts exceed the corresponding amounts fixed by the impor-<br>ting country, the latter shall accept them if the products are invoiced in the<br>currency of the exporting country. When the products are invoiced in the<br>currency of another EC Member State or EFTA State, the importing country<br>shall recognize the amount notified by the country concerned.</p>
<p>2. Up to and including 30 April 1998, the amounts to be used in any given<br>national currency shall be the equivalent in that national currency of the<br>amounts expressed in ECU as at 1 October 1992.</p>
<p>For each successive period of five years, the amounts expressed in ECU<br>and their equivalents in the national currencies of the EC Member States<br>and the EFTA States shall be reviewed by the EEA Joint Committee on the<br>basis of the exchange rates of the ECU as at the first working day in October<br>in the year immediately preceding that five years’ period.</p>
<p>When carrying out this review, the EEA Joint Committee shall ensure that<br>there will be no decrease in the amounts to be used in any national currency<br>and shall furthermore consider the desirability of preserving the effects of<br>the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify<br>the amounts expressed in ECU.</p>

<h1>APPENDIX I</h1>
<h2>INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN<br>APPENDIX II</h2>
<p>Note 1:</p>
<p>The list sets out for all products covered by the Agreement the condi-<br>tions required for these products to be considered as sufficiently worked<br>or processed within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the Protocol.</p>
<p>Note 2:</p>
<p>2.1 The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first<br>column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Har-<br>monized System and the second column gives the description of goods<br>used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the<br>first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some<br>cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an “ex”, this signifies<br>that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading or<br>chapter as described in column 2.</p>
<p>2.2 Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a<br>chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is<br>therefore given in general terms, the adj acent rules in columns 3 or 4<br>apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classi-<br>fied in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped toget-<br>her in column 1.</p>
<p>2.3 Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products<br>within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of<br>the heading covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4.</p>
<p>2.4 Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both<br>columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either<br>the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule<br>is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.</p>
<p>Note 3:</p>
<p>3.1 The provisions of Article 4(1) of the Protocol concerning products ha-<br>ving acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of<br>other products apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired<br>inside the factory where these products are used, in another factory in<br>the same country or in another EEA country.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>An engine of heading No. 84.07, for which the rule States that the<br>value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated<br>may not exceed 40% of the ex-works price, is made from other alloy<br>Steel roughly shaped by forging of heading No. ex 72.24.</p>
<p>If this forging has been forged in the EEA froma non-originating<br>ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule<br>for heading No. ex 72.24 in the list. The forging can then count as<br>originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whet-<br>her it was produced in the same factory, in another factory in the</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 15</p>
<p>Protocol4</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>same country or in another EEA country. The value of the non-origi-<br>nating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value<br>of the non-originating materials used.</p>
<p>3.2 The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or pro-<br>cessing required and the carrying out of more working or processing<br>also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less wor-<br>king or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus if a rule provi-<br>des that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may<br>be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is<br>allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.</p>
<p>3.3 When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured<br>from more than one material, this means that any one or more materials<br>may be used. It does not require that all be used.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>The rule for fabrics of ex Chapter 50 to Chapter 55 provides that natu-<br>ral fibres may be used and that Chemical materials, among other ma-<br>terials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be<br>used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.</p>
<p>3.4 Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured<br>from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the<br>use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot<br>satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>The rule for prepared foods of heading No. 19.04 which specifically<br>excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the<br>use of mineral salts, Chemicals and other additives which are not pro-<br>duced from cereals.</p>
<p>However, this does not apply to products which, although they can-<br>not be manufactured from the particular material specified in the list,<br>can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage<br>of manufacture.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-<br>woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for<br>this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth -<br>even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such<br>cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before<br>yarn - that is the fibre stage.</p>
<p>3.5 Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum<br>value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percen-<br>tages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value<br>of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the highest<br>of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must<br>not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.</p>
<p>Note 4:</p>
<p>4.1 The term “natural fibres” is used in the list to refer to fibres other than</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 15</p>
<p>Protocol 4</p>
<p>artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning<br>takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes<br>fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not<br>spun.</p>
<p>4.2 The term “natural fibres” includes horsehair of heading No. 05.03, silk<br>of heading Nos. 50.02 and 50.03 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse<br>animal hair of heading Nos. 51.01 to 51.05, the cotton fibres of heading<br>Nos. 52.01 to 52.03 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos. 53.01<br>to 53.05.</p>
<p>4.3 The terms “textile pulp”, “Chemical materials” and “paper-making ma-<br>terials” are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in<br>Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic<br>or paper fibres or yarns.</p>
<p>4.4 The term “man-made staple fibres” is used in the list to refer to synthe-<br>tic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos.<br>55.01 to 55.07.</p>
<p>Note 5:</p>
<p>5.1 Where for a given product in the List a reference is made to this Note,<br>the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic tex-<br>tile materials, used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken to-<br>gether, represent 10% or less of the total weight of all the basic textile<br>materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).</p>
<p>5.2 However, this tolerance may only be applied to mixed products which<br>have been made from two or more basic textile materials.</p>
<p>The following are the basic textile materials:</p>
<p>- silk,</p>
<p>- wool,</p>
<p>- coarse animal hair,</p>
<p>- fine animal hair,</p>
<p>- horsehair,</p>
<p>- cotton,</p>
<p>- paper-making materials and paper,</p>
<p>- flax,</p>
<p>- true hemp,</p>
<p>- jute and other textile bast fibres,</p>
<p>- sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,</p>
<p>- coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,</p>
<p>- synthetic man-made filaments</p>
<p>- artificial man-made filaments</p>
<p>- synthetic man-made staple fibres,</p>
<p>- artificial man-made staple fibres.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>A yarn of heading No. 52.05 made from cotton fibres of heading No.<br>52.03 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No. 55.06 is a mixed yarn.<br>Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy<br>the origin rules (which require manufacture from Chemical materials<br>or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10% of the yarn.</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 15</p>
<p>Protocol 4</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>A woollen fabric of heading No. 51.12 made from woollen yarn of<br>heading No. 51.07 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No.<br>55.09 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not sa-<br>tisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from Chemical mate-<br>rials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin<br>rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or<br>combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the<br>two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 % of<br>the weight of the fabric.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Tufted textile fabric of heading No. 58.02 made from cotton yarn of<br>heading No. 52.05 and cotton fabric of heading No. 52.10 is only a<br>mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made<br>from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns<br>used are themselves mixtures.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn<br>of heading No. 52.05 and synthetic fabric of heading No. 54.07, then,<br>obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and<br>the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>A carpet with tufts made from both artificial yarns and cotton yarns<br>and with a jute backing is a mixed product because three basic textile<br>materials are used. Thus, any non-originating materials that are at a<br>later stage of manufacture than the rule allows may be used, provided<br>their total weight does not exceed 10% of the weight of the textiles<br>materials of the carpet. Thus, both the jute backing and/or the artififi-<br>cal yarns could be imported at that stage of manufacture, provided<br>the weight conditions are met.</p>
<p>5.3 In the case of products incorporating “yarn made of polyurethane seg-<br>mented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped” this<br>tolerance is 20% in respect of this yarn.</p>
<p>5.4 &nbsp;In the case of products incorporating strip consisting of a core of alumi-<br>nium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with alumi-<br>nium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of<br>an adhesive between two films of plastic film, this tolerance is 30% in<br>respect of this strip.</p>
<p>Note 6:</p>
<p>6.1 In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a<br>footnote referring to this note, textile materials, with the exception of<br>linings and interlinings, which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list<br>in column 3 for the made up product concerned may be used provided<br>that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and<br>that their value does not exceed 8% of the ex- works price of the pro-<br>duct.</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 15</p>
<p>Protocol4</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>6.2 Materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be used<br>freely, whether or not they contain textiles.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>If a rule in the list provides that for a particular textile item, such as<br>trousers, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal<br>items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within<br>Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of<br>slide-fasteners even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.</p>
<p>6.3 Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not<br>classified within chapter 50 to 63 must be taken into account when cal-<br>culating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.</p>

<h2>ON SIMPLIFICATION OF INSPECTIONS AND<br>FORMALITIES IN RESPECT OF CARRIAGE OF<br>GOODS</h2>
<p>CHAPTERI</p>
<p>GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
<p>Article 1</p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Protocol:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;'inspections’ shall mean the carrying out by customs or any other su-<br>pervisory department of an operation which consists of the physical<br>examination, including visual inspection, of the means of transport<br>and/or the goods themselves with the aim of checking that their na-<br>ture, origin, State, quantity or value are in conformity with the parti-<br>culars given in the documents which have been presented;</p>
<p>(b) 'formalities’ shall mean any formality imposed on operators by the<br>administration consisting in the presentation or examination of do-<br>cuments and certificates accompanying goods or other particulars,<br>irrespective of form or medium, relating to the goods or means of<br>transport.</p>
<p>Article 2</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>1. Without prejudice to the specific provisions in force under agreements<br>concluded between the European Economic Community and EFTA States,<br>this Protocol shall apply to inspections and formalities concerning the car-<br>riage of goods which have to cross a frontier between an EFTA State and the<br>Community, as well as between the EFTA States.</p>
<p>2. This Protocol shall not apply to inspections or formalities:</p>
<p>- &nbsp;in respect of ships and aircraft as means of transport; however, it shall<br>apply to vehicles and goods carried by the said means of transport;</p>
<p>- &nbsp;required for the issue of health or plant health certificates in the country<br>of origin or of provenance of the goods.</p>
<p>CHAPTER II</p>
<p>PROCEDURES</p>
<p>Article 3</p>
<p>Random checks and formalities</p>
<p>1. Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Protocol, the Contracting<br>Parties shall take the necessary measures to ensure that:</p>
<p>- &nbsp;the different inspections and formalities provided for in Article 2(1) are</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 15</p>
<p>Protocol 10</p>
<p>208</p>
<p>carried out with the minimum delay necessary and, in so far as possible,<br>at one place;</p>
<p>- inspections are carried out by means of random checks, except in duly<br>justified circumstances.</p>
<p>2. For the purposes of implementing the second indent of paragraph 1, the<br>basis for carrying out random checks shall be the total number of consign-<br>ments passing through a frontier post and presented to a customs office or<br>inspection authority during a given period, and not the total number of goods<br>making up each consignment.</p>
<p>3. The Contracting Parties shall facilitate, at the places of departure and des-<br>tination of goods, the use of simplified procedures and data processing and<br>data transmission techniques for the purposes of the export, transit and im-<br>port of goods.</p>
<p>4. The Contracting Parties shall endeavour to deploy customs offices, inclu-<br>ding those in the interiör of their territory, in such a way as best to take ac-<br>count of the requirements of commercial operators.</p>
<p>Article 4</p>
<p>Veterinary rules</p>
<p>In areas relating to the protection of human and animal health and the pro-<br>tection of animals, implementation of the principles set out in Articles 3, 7<br>and 13 and the rules governing the fees to be charged in respect of the forma-<br>lities and inspections carried out shall be decided upon by the EEA Joint<br>Committee in accordance with Article 93(2) of the Agreement.</p>
<p>Article 5</p>
<p>Plant health rules</p>
<p>1. Plant health inspections of imports shall take the form only of random<br>checks and sample testing except in duly justified circumstances. Such in-<br>spections shall be carried out at either the place of destination of the goods<br>or another place designated within the respective territories on condition<br>that the itinerary of the goods is affected to the least possible extent.</p>
<p>2. Rules governing the carrying out of identity checks on imports in relation<br>to goods covered by plant health legislation shall be adopted by the EEA<br>Joint Committee in accordance with Article 93(2) of the Agreement. The<br>measures pertaining to the fees to be charged in respect of plant health for-<br>malities and inspections shall be decided upon by the EEA Joint Committee<br>in accordance with Article 93(2) of the Agreement.</p>
<p>3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to goods other than those produced in<br>the Community or in an EFTA State except in cases where, by their nature,<br>they present no plant health risk or in cases where they have undergone a<br>plant health inspection on entering the territory of the respective Contrac-<br>ting Parties, and are found, at the time of such inspections, to meet the requi-<br>rements relating to plant health laid down in their legislation.</p>

<p>Protocol 10</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>4. Where a Contracting Party considers that there is imminent danger of the<br>introduction or sprcad of harmful organisms in its territory, it may take such<br>temporary measures as are necessary to protect itself against that danger.<br>The Contracting Parties shall notify one another forthwith of the measures<br>taken and of the reasons which made them necessary.</p>
<p>Article 6</p>
<p>Delegation of powers</p>
<p>The Contracting Parties shall see to it that, by express delegation by the com-<br>petent authorities and on their behalf, one of the other services represented,<br>and preferably the customs service, may carry out inspections for which<br>those authorities are responsible and, in so far as such inspections reläte to<br>the requirement to produce the necessary documents, checks on the validity<br>and authenticity thereof and on the identity of the goods declared in such<br>documents. In that event the authorities concerned shall ensure that the<br>means required for carrying out such checks are made available.</p>
<p>Article 7</p>
<p>Recognition of inspections and documents</p>
<p>For the purposes of implementing this Protocol and without prejudice to the<br>possibility of carrying out random checks, the Contracting Parties shall, in<br>the event of goods being imported or entering in transit, recognize the in-<br>spections carried out and the documents drawn up by the competent authori-<br>ties of the other Contracting Parties which certify that the goods comply with<br>the legal requirements of the country of import or equivalent requirements<br>in the country of export.</p>
<p>Article 8</p>
<p>Opening hours offrontier posts</p>
<p>1. Where the volume of traffic so warrants, the Contracting Parties shall see<br>to it that:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;frontier posts are open, except when traffic is prohibited, so that:<br>frontiers can be crosscd twenty-four hours a day with the correspon-<br>ding inspections and formalities in respect of goods placed under a<br>customs transit procedure, their means of transport and vehicles tra-<br>velling unladen, save where frontier inspection is necessary in order<br>to prevent the spread of disease or protect animals;</p>
<p>inspections and formalities relating to the movement of means of<br>transport and goods which are not moving under a customs transit<br>procedure may be performed from Monday to Friday during an<br>uninterrupted period of at least ten hours, and on Saturday during<br>an uninterrupted period of at least six hours, unless those days are<br>public holidays;</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;as regards vehicles and goods transported by air, the periods refer-</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 15</p>
<p>Protocol 10</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>red to in the second indent of subparagraph (a) are adapted in such<br>a way as to meet actual needs and for that purpose are split or exten-<br>ded if necessary.</p>
<p>2. Where general compliance with the periods referred to in the second in-<br>dent of subparagraph l(a) and in subparagraph l(b) poses problems for vete-<br>rinary services, the Contracting Parties shall see to it that, subject to at least<br>twelve hours’ notice being given by the carrier, a veterinary expert is avai-<br>lable during those periods; in the case of the transport of live animals, howe-<br>ver, the period of such notice may be increased to eighteen hours.</p>
<p>3. Where several frontier posts are situated in the immediate vicinity of one<br>and the same frontier zone, the Contracting Parties concerned may jointly<br>agree for certain of such posts, to derogate from paragraph 1 provided that<br>the other posts in that zone are able to clear goods and vehicles in accordance<br>with that paragraph.</p>
<p>4. As regards the frontier posts and customs offices and services referred to<br>in paragraph 1, and under the conditions laid down by the Contracting Par-<br>ties, the competent authorities shall, if specifically requested during business<br>hours and for sound reasons, provide for inspections and formalities to be<br>carried out, as an exception, outside business hours, on condition that,<br>where relevant, payment is made for services so rendered.</p>
<p>Article 9</p>
<p>Express lanes</p>
<p>The Contracting Parties shall endeavour to establish at frontier posts, where<br>technically possible and justified by the volume of traffic, express lanes re-<br>served for goods placed under a customs transit procedure, their means of<br>transport, vehicles travelling unladen and all goods subject to such inspec-<br>tions and formalities as do not exceed those required in respect of goods pla-<br>ced under a transit procedure.</p>
<p>CHAPTER III</p>
<p>COOPERATION</p>
<p>Article 10</p>
<p>Cooperation between authorities</p>
<p>1. In order to facilitate the Crossing of frontiers, the Contracting Parties shall<br>take the measures necessary to extend cooperation at both national and re-<br>gional or local level between the authorities responsible for the organization<br>of inspections and between the various departments carrying out inspections<br>and formalities on either side of such frontiers.</p>
<p>2. Each Contracting Party shall, in so far as it is concerned, see to it that<br>persons engaged in trade covered by this Protocol can rapidly inform the<br>competent authorities of any problems encountered when Crossing frontiers.</p>
<p>3. The cooperation referred to in paragraph 1 shall cover in particular:</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 15</p>
<p>Protocol 10</p>
<p>211</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;the arrangement of frontier posts in such a way as to meet traffic<br>requirements;</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;the conversion of frontier offices into juxtaposed inspection offices,<br>where possible;</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;the harmonization of the responsibilities of the frontier posts and<br>offices situated on either side of the frontier;</p>
<p>(d) the seeking of appropriate Solutions to any problems reported.</p>
<p>4. The Contracting Parties shall cooperate in order to harmonize the busi-<br>ness hours of the various departments carrying out inspections and formali-<br>ties on either side of the frontier.</p>
<p>Article 11</p>
<p>Notification of new inspections and formalities</p>
<p>Where a Contracting Party intends to introduce a new inspection or forma-<br>lity, it shall inform the other Contracting Parties thereof. The Contracting<br>Party concerned shall ensure that the measures taken to facilitate the Cros-<br>sing of frontiers are not rendered inoperative through the application of such<br>new inspections or formalities.</p>
<p>Article 12</p>
<p>Free flow of traffic</p>
<p>1. The Contracting Parties shall take the measures necessary to ensure that<br>waiting time caused by the various inspections and formalities does not ex-<br>ceed the time required for their proper completion. To that end, they shall<br>organize the business hours of the departments which are to carry out inspec-<br>tions and formalities, the staff available and the practical arrangements for<br>processing goods and documents associated with the carrying out of inspec-<br>tions and formalities in such a way as to reduce waiting time in the flow of<br>traffic to the fullest possible extent.</p>
<p>2. The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties in whose territory<br>serious disruption in regard to the carriage of goods occurs, which is likely<br>to jeopardize the objectives of simplifying and expediting the Crossing of<br>frontiers, shall immediately inform the competent authorities of the other<br>Contracting Parties affected by such disruption.</p>
<p>3. The competent authorities of each Contracting Party so affected shall im-<br>mediately take appropriate measures to ensure, as far as possible, the free<br>flow of traffic. The measures shall be notified to the EEA Joint Committee<br>which shall, where appropriate, meet in emergency session at the request of<br>a Contracting Party, to diseuss these measures.</p>
<p>Article 13</p>
<p>Administrative assistance</p>

<p>2.

<h2>CONCERNING THE DEFINITION OF</h2>
<h2>’UNDERTAKING’</h2>
<h2>AND TURNOVER’ (ARTICLE 56)</h2>
<p>Article 1</p>
<p>For the purposes of the attribution of individual cases pursuant to Article 56<br>of the Agreement, an 'undertaking’ shall be any entity carrying out activities<br>of a commercial or economic nature.</p>
<p>Article 2</p>
<p>Turnover’ within the meaning of Article 56 of the Agreement shall comprise<br>the amounts derived by the undertakings concerned, in the territory covered<br>by the Agreement, in the preceding financial year from the sale of products<br>and the provision of services falling within the undertaking’s ordinary scope<br>of activities after deduction of sales rebates and of value added tax and other<br>taxes directly related to turnover.</p>
<p>Article 3</p>
<p>In place of turnover, the following shall be used:</p>
<p>(a) for credit institutions and other financial institutions, their total as-<br>sets multiplied by the ratio between loans and advances to credit<br>institutions and customers in transactions with residents in the terri-<br>tory covered by the Agreement and the total sum of those loans and<br>advances;</p>
<p>(b) for insurance undertakings, the value of gross premiums received<br>from residents in the territory covered by the Agreement, which<br>shall comprise all amounts received and receivable in respect of in-<br>surance contracts issued by or on behalf of the insurance underta-<br>kings, including also outgoing reinsurance premiums, and after de-<br>duction of taxes and parafiscal contributions or levies charged by<br>reference to the amounts of individual premiums or the total value<br>of premiums.</p>
<p>Article 4</p>
<p>1. In derogation from the definition of the turnover relevant for the applica-<br>tion of Article 56 of the Agreement, as contained in Article 2 of this Proto-<br>col, the relevant turnover shall be constituted:</p>
<p>(a) as regards agreements, decisions of associations of undertakings<br>and concerted practices related to distribution and supply arrange-<br>ments between non-competing undertakings, of the amounts deri-<br>ved from the sale of goods or the provision of services which are the<br>subject matter of the agreements, decisions or concerted practices,<br>and from the other goods or services which are considered by users</p>

<p>to be equivalent in view of their characteristics, price and intended<br>use;</p>
<p>(b) as regards agreements, decisions of associations of undertakings<br>and concerted practices related to arrangements on transfer of tech-<br>nology between non-competing undertakings, of the amounts deri-<br>ved from the sale of goods or the provision of services which result<br>from the technology which is the subject matter of the agreements,<br>decisions or concerted practices, and of the amounts derived from<br>the sale of those goods or the provision of those services which that<br>technology is designed to improve or replace.</p>
<p>2. However, where at the time of the coming into existence of arrangements<br>as described in paragraph 1 (a) and (b) turnover as regards the sale of goods<br>or the provision of services is not in evidence, the general provision as contai-<br>ned in Article 2 shall apply.</p>
<p>Article 5</p>
<p>1. Where individual cases concern products falling within the scope of appli-<br>cation of Protocol 25, the relevant turnover for the attribution of those cases<br>shall be the turnover achieved in these products.</p>
<p>2. Where individual cases concern products falling within the scope of appli-<br>cation of Protocol 25 as well as products or services falling within the scope<br>of application of Articles 53 and 54 of the Agreement, the relevant turnover<br>is determined by taking into account all the products and services as provided<br>for in Article 2 .</p>

All agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of un-<br>dertakings and concerted practices in respect of particular products referred<br>to in Protocol 14 which may affect trade between Contracting Parties tending<br>directly or indirectly to prevent, restrict or distort normal competition within<br>the territory covered by this Agreement shall be prohibited, and in particular<br>those tending:</p>
<p>(a) to fix or determine prices;</p>
<p>(b) to restrict or control production, technical development or invest-<br>ment;</p>
<p>(c) to share markets, products, customers or sources of supply.</p>
<p>2. However, the competent surveillance authority, as provided for in Article<br>56 of the Agreement, shall authorize specialization agreements or joint-<br>buying or joint-selling agreements in respect of the products referred to in<br>paragraph 1, if it finds that:</p>
<p>(a) such specialization or such joint-buying or joint-selling will make<br>for a substantial improvement in the production or distribution of<br>those products;</p>
<p>(b) the agreement in question is essential in order to achieve these re-<br>sults and is not more restrictive than is necessary for that purpose;<br>and</p>
<p>(c) the agreement is not liable to give the undertakings concerned the<br>power to determine the prices, or to control or restrict the produc-<br>tion or marketing, of a substantial part of the products in question<br>within the territory covered by the Agreement, or to shield them<br>against effective competition from other undertakings within the<br>territory covered by the Agreement.</p>
<p>If the competent surveillance authority finds that certain agreements are<br>strictly analogous in nature and effect to those referred to above, having par-<br>ticular regard to the fact that this paragraph applies to distributive underta-<br>kings, it shall authorize them also when satisfied that they meet the same<br>requirements.</p>
<p>3. Any agreement or decision prohibited by paragraph 1 shall be automati-<br>cally void and may not be relied upon before any court or tribunal in the EC<br>Member States or the EFTA States.</p>

<p>Article 2</p>
<p>1. Any transaction shall require the prior authorization of the competent<br>surveillance authority, as provided for in Article 56 of the Agreement, sub-<br>ject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article, if it has in itself the direct<br>or indirect effect of bringing about within the territory covered by the Agree-</p>

<p>ment, as a result of action by any person or undertaking or group of persons<br>or undertakings, a concentration between undertakings at least one of which<br>is covered by Article 3, which may affect trade between Contracting Parties,<br>whether the transaction concerns a single product or a number of different<br>products, and whether it is effected by merger, acquisition of shares or parts<br>of the undertaking or assets, loan, contract or any other means of control.</p>
<p>2. The competent surveillance authority, as provided for in Article 56 of the<br>Agreement, shall grant the authorization referred to in paragraph 1 if it finds<br>that the proposed transaction will not give to the persons or undertakings<br>concerned the power, in respect of the product or products within its jurisdic-<br>tion:</p>
<p>- &nbsp;to determine prices, to control or restrict production or distribution or to<br>hinder effective competition in a substantial part of the market for those<br>products; or</p>
<p>- &nbsp;to evade the rules of competition instituted under this Agreement, in par-<br>ticular by establishing an artificially privileged position involving a sub-<br>stantial advantage in access to supplies or markets.</p>
<p>3. Classes of transactions may, in view of the size of the assets or underta-<br>kings concerned, taken in conjunction with the kind of concentration to be<br>effected, be exempted from the requirement of prior authorization.</p>
<p>4. If the competent surveillance authority, as provided for in Article 56 of<br>the Agreement, finds that public or private undertakings which, in law or in<br>fact, hold or acquire in the market for one of the products within its jurisdic-<br>tion a dominant position shielding them against effective competition in a<br>substantial part of the territory covered by this Agreement are using that<br>position for purposes contrary to the objectives of this Agreement and if such<br>abuse may affect trade between Contracting Parties, it shall make to them<br>such recommendations as may be appropriate to prevent the position from<br>being so used.</p>
<p>Article 3</p>
<p>For the purposes of Articles 1 and 2 as well as for the purposes of information<br>required for their application and proceedings in connection with them, 'un-<br>dertaking’ means any undertaking engaged in production in the coal or the<br>Steel industry within the territory covered by the Agreement, and any under-<br>taking or agency regularly engaged in distribution other than sale to domes-<br>tic consumers or small craft industries.</p>

<h2>ON FINANCIAL MODALITIES FOR<br>IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE 82</h2>
<p>Article 1</p>
<p>Procedure for the determination of the financial participation of the EFTA<br>States</p>
<p>1. The procedure for the calculation of the financial participation of the<br>EFTA States in Community activities shall be that set out in the following<br>paragraphs.</p>
<p>2. The EC Commission shall communicate to the EEA Joint Committee to-<br>gether with relevant background material at the latest on 30 May of each<br>financial year:</p>
<p>(a) the amounts entered “for information”, in commitment appropria-<br>tions and payment appropriations, in the statement of expenditure<br>of the preliminaiy draft general budget of the European Communi-<br>ties, corresponding to the activities in which the EFTA States take<br>part and calculated in accordance with the provisions of Article 82;</p>
<p>(b) the estimated amount of the contributions, entered for information<br>in the statement of revenue of the preliminary draft budget, corre-<br>sponding to the participation of the EFTA States in these activities.</p>
<p>3. The EEA Joint Committee shall, before 1 July each year, confirm that the<br>amounts referred to in paragraph 2 are in accordance with the provisions of<br>Article 82 of the Agreement.</p>
<p>4. The amounts “for information” corresponding to the participation of the<br>EFTA States, both in commitment appropriations and in payment appro-<br>priations, as well as the amount of the contributions, shall be adjusted when<br>the budget is adopted by the budgetary authority, in order to respect the pro-<br>visions of Article 82.</p>
<p>5. As soon as the general budget has been finally adopted by the budgetary<br>authority the EC Commission shall communicate to the EEA Joint Commit-<br>tee the amounts which are entered therein “for information” both in the sta-<br>tement of revenue and of expenditure corresponding to the participation of<br>the EFTA States.</p>
<p>The EEA Joint Committee shall, within a period of 15 days following that<br>communication, confirm that these amounts are in accordance with the pro-<br>visions of Article 82.</p>
<p>6. By 1 January at the latest of each financial year, the Standing Committee<br>of the EFTA States shall inform the EC Commission of the final breakdown<br>of the contribution for each EFTA State.</p>
<p>This breakdown shall be of a binding character for each EFTA State.</p>
<p>Should this information not be provided by 1 January, the breakdown of<br>the previous year shall apply on a provisional basis.</p>

<p>Article 2</p>
<p>Making available the contributions of the EFTA States</p>
<p>1. On the basis of the information transmitted by the Standing Committee<br>of the EFTA States pursuant to the provisions of Article 1(6) above, the EC<br>Commission shall establish:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;pursuant to Article 28.1 of the Financial Regulation<sup>1</sup> a proposal for a<br>claim, corresponding to the amount of the participation of the EFTA<br>States, calculated on the basis of the commitment appropriations.<br>The drawing up of the proposal for a claim shall give rise to the for-<br>mal opening by the EC Commission of the commitment appropria-<br>tions on the budgetary lines concerned within the framework of the<br>budgetary structure created to this end.</p>
<p>If the budget has not been adopted by the opening of the financial<br>year, the provisions of Article 9 of the Financial Regulation shall ap-<br>ply.</p>
<p>(b) pursuant to Article 28(2) of the Financial Regulation, a call for funds<br>corresponding to the amount of the contributions of the EFTA Sta-<br>tes, calculated on the basis of the payment appropriations.</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 15</p>
<p>Protocol 32</p>
<p>2. This order shall provide for the payment, by each EFTA State, of its cont-<br>ribution in two stages:</p>
<p>- &nbsp;six twelfths of its contribution not later than 20 January</p>
<p>- &nbsp;six twelfths of its contribution not later than 15 July.</p>
<p>However, the six twelfths to be paid at the latest on 20 January are calculated<br>on the basis of the amount, “for information” set out in the statement of re-<br>venue of the preliminary draft budget: the regularization of the amounts thus<br>paid shall occur with the payment of the twelfths falling due on 15 July.</p>
<p>If the budget is not adopted before 30 March, the second payment shall<br>also take place on the basis of the amount foreseen “for information” in the<br>preliminary draft budget. The regularization shall take place three months<br>after the completion of the procedures provided for in Article 1(5).</p>
<p>The collections corresponding to the payment by the EFTA States of their<br>contributions shall give rise to the formal opening of payment appropriations<br>on the budgetary lines concerned within the framework of the budgetary<br>structure created to this end without prejudice to the application of the pro-<br>visions of Article 9 of the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p>3. Contributions shall be expressed and paid in ecu.</p>
<p>4. To this end, each EFTA State shall open with its Treasury or the body<br>it shall designate for this purpose an account in ecus on behalf of the EC<br>Commission.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the<br>European Communities (OJ L No L 355, 31.12.1977, p. 1), as modified by Council<br>Regulation (Euratom,ECSC,EEC) No 610/90 of 13 March 1990 (OJ No L 70,<br>16.3.1990, p. 1), hereinafter referred to as the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p>5. Any delay in the entries in the account referred to in paragraph 4 in rela-<br>tion to the deadlines set out in paragraph 2 shall give rise to the payment, by<br>the EFTA State concerned, of interest at a rate equal to the rate applied by<br>the European Monetary Co-operation Fund to its operations in ecus, plus<br>1,5 of a percentage point, for the month of the expiration date and published<br>each month in the Official Journal of the European Communities, series C.</p>
<p>Article 3</p>
<p>Adjustments in the light of implementation</p>
<p>1. The amounts of the participation of the EFTA States, determined for<br>each budgetary line concerned, in accordance with the provisions of Article<br>82 of the Agreement shall normally remain unchanged during the financial<br>year in question.</p>
<p>2. The EC Commission, at the time of the closure of the accounts relating<br>to each financial year (n), within the framework of the establishment of the<br>revenue and expenditure account, shall proceed to the regularization of the<br>accounts with respect to the participation of the EFTA States, taking into<br>consideration:</p>
<p>- &nbsp;modifications which have taken place, either by transfer or by supple-<br>mentary budget during the financial year;</p>
<p>- &nbsp;the final implementation of the appropriations for the financial year, ta-<br>king into account possible cancellations and carry-overs;</p>
<p>- any sums covering Community related expenditure which the EFTA Sta-<br>tes cover individually or payments made by EFTA States in kind, e.g.<br>administrative support.</p>
<p>This regularization shall occur in the framework of the establishment of<br>the budget for the following year (n + 2).</p>
<p>3. However, in exceptional circumstances duly justified, and in so far as the<br>proportionality factor has to be safeguarded, the EC Commission may re-<br>quest, from the EFTA States, after approval by the EEA Joint Committee,<br>an additional contribution during the same financial year as that during<br>which the variation has occurred. Such additional contributions shall be re-<br>gistered on the accounts referred to in Article 2(4) on a date to be fixed by<br>the EEA Joint Committee and which shall as far as possible coincide with<br>the regularization foreseen in Article 2(2). In the event of delay in these regi-<br>strations, the provisions of Article 2(5) shall apply.</p>
<p>4. Complementary rules for the implementation of paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be<br>adopted as necessary by the EEA Joint Committee.</p>
<p>This shall apply in particular as regards the manner in which account shall<br>be taken of any sums covering Community related expenditure which the<br>EFTA States cover individually or payments made by EFTA States in kind.</p>

Notwithstanding the integration into this Agreement of Council Directive<br>91/68/EEC on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in<br>ovine and caprine animals and awaiting the outcome of ongoing discussions<br>aimed at arriving, as soon as possible, at an overall agreement related to the<br>application by Austria, Finland and Norway of this legislation, these Cont-<br>racting Parties may apply their national legislation. The other Contracting<br>Parties may maintain their third country regime towards these countries in<br>this field. The Contracting Parties shall review the situation during 1995.</p>
<p>8. Notwithstanding the integration into this Agreement of Council Directive<br>91/67/EEC concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on<br>the market of aquaculture animals and products and awaiting the outcome<br>of ongoing discussions aimed at arriving, as soon as possible, at an overall<br>agreement related to the application by Finland, Iceland and Norway of this<br>legislation, these Contracting Parties may apply their national legislation<br>concerning live fish and crustaceans as well as eggs and gametes of fish and<br>crustaceans for farming or restocking.

<p>(a) the legislation on producers’ organizations reflects the principles of the<br>“acquis communautaire” regarding:</p>
<p>establishment on the producers’ initiative;</p>
<p>- freedom to become and cease to be a member;</p>
<p>absence of a dominant position, unless necessary in pur-<br>suance of objectives corresponding to those specified in Ar-<br>ticle 39 of the EEC Treaty;</p>
<p>(b) whenever the rules of producers’ organizations are extended to non-<br>members of producers’ organizations, the provisions to be applied corre-<br>spond to those laid down in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No. 3687/91;</p>
<p>(c) whenever provisions in respect of interventions to support prices exist or<br>are established, they correspond to those specified in Title III of Regulation<br>(EEC) No. 3687/91.</p>
<h2>JOINT DECLARATION</h2>
<h2>CONCERNING THE APPLICATION OF TARIFF<br>CONCESSIONS FOR CERTAIN AGRICULTURAL<br>PRODUCTS</h2>
<p>The Contracting Parties declare that in case of tariff concessions granted for<br>the same product, both under Protocol 3 to the Agreement and under a bila-<br>teral agreement on trade in agricultural products as referred to in Protocol 42<br>to the above-mentioned Agreement, the most advantageous tariff treatment<br>shall be granted upon submission of the relevant documentation.</p>
<p>This is without prejudice to the obligations resulting from Article 16 of the<br>Agreement.</p>
<h2>JOINT DECLARATION</h2>
<h2>ON PLANT HEALTH ISSUES</h2>
<p>The Contracting Parties State that the existing Community acts in this area<br>are under review. Therefore, this legislation will not be taken over by the<br></p>

<h2>JOINT DECLARATION</h2>
<h2>ON MUTUAL ASSISTANCE BETWEEN CONTROL<br>AUTHORITIES IN THE AREA OF SPIRIT DRINKS</h2>
<p>The Contracting Parties agree that any future EC legislation on mutual assis-<br>tance in the area of spirit drinks between the competent authorities of EC<br>Member States, relevant for this Agreement, shall be dealt with according<br>to the general provisions on decision making of the Agreement.</p>
<h2>JOINT DECLARATION</h2>
<h2>ON PROTOCOL 47 ON THE ABOLITION OF<br>TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE IN WINE</h2>
<p>The adaptation concerning the use of the terms 'Federweiss’ and 'Federweis-<br>ser’ as provided for in the Appendix to Protocol 47, shall be without preju-<br>dice to any future modifications of the relevant Community legislation where<br>provisions may be introduced regulating the use of the same terms and their<br>equivalents for wine produced in the Community.</p>
<p>The classification of EFTA States’ wine producing regions in wine-gro-<br>wing zone B for the purposes of this Agreement, shall not prejudge any fu-<br>ture modifications of the Community’s classification scheme which may have<br>a subsequent impact on the classification within the framework of the Agree-<br>ment. Any such modifications shall be dealt with in accordance with the ge-<br>neral provisions of the Agreement.</p>
<h2>JOINT DECLARATION</h2>
<h2>ON MODIFICATION OF TARIFF CONCESSIONS<br>AND ON SPECIAL TREATMENT OF SPAIN AND<br>PORTUGAL</h2>
<p>A full implementation of the system outlined in Protocol 3 depends in some<br>Contracting Parties on amendments to the national price compensation sy-<br>stem. These amendments are not possible without the modification of tariff<br>concessions. Such modifications would not imply the need for compensation<br>between the Contracting Parties of the EEA Agreement.</p>
<p>The system outlined in Protocol 3 does not preclude the application of the<br>relevant transitional provisions of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal<br>and shall not result in the Community, in its composition as of 31 December<br>1985, granting Contracting Parties to the EEA Agreement a more favou-<br>rable treatment than the one applied to the new EC Member States. In parti-<br>cular, the application of this system does not preclude the application of the<br>accession price compensatory amounts established in application of the Act<br>of Accession of Spain and Portugal.</p>

Consensus will be recorded and finalized either in<br>Additional Protocols to be attached to the EEA Agreement, or in appro-<br>priate decisions by the EEA Joint Committee after the entry into force of the<br>Agreement. Any substantial negotiating problems arising under the interim<br>arrangement will be dealt with by the EEA Joint Committee after the entry<br>into force of the Agreement.</p>
<p>It being understood that the information and consultation procedures of<br>the EEA Agreement can only be applied after the latter’s entry into force,<br>the Community will inform the EFTA States during the interim phase on<br>proposals for new Community acquis after they have been submitted to the<br>EC Council of Ministers.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>
<p>With regard to publication of EEA relevant information to be published af-<br>ter the entry into force of the EEA Agreement, I have the honour to summa-<br>rize the agreement we have reached as follows.</p>
<p>There will be a co-ordinated system consisting of the Official Journal of<br>the EC and a special EEA supplement thereto. Where information to be<br>published both for the EC and the EFTA States is identical, publication by<br>the EC in the Official Journal of the EC will serve at the same time as publi-<br>cation in the three common EC/EFTA languages, while the information in<br>the remaining four EFTA languages (Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian and<br>Swedish) will be published in the EEA supplement to the Official Journal of<br>the EC. The EFTA States undertake to provide an appropriate infrastruc-<br>ture in order to ensure the timely availability of the necessary translations<br>into the four non-EC EFTA languages. The EFTA States will be responsible<br>for producing the material for the production of the EEA supplement.</p>
<p>The publication system would contain the following elements:</p>
<p>(a) Decisions of the EEA Joint Committee relating to the acquis and other<br>decisions, acts, notices, etc., by the EEHA organs</p>
<p>The decisions of the EEA Joint Committee relating to the acquis shall be<br>published in the nine official languages in a special EEA section of the Offi-<br>cial Journal of the EC. That publication will serve as publication in relation<br>to the three common languages. These decisions will also be published in the<br>EEA supplement in the official languages of the Nordic EFTA States and,<br>under the responsibility of the EFTA States, possibly, for information, in the<br>EFTA working language.</p>
<p>The same applies to other decisions, acts, notices, etc., by the EEA or-<br>gans, in particular the EEA Council and the EEA Joint Committee.</p>
<p>As concerns decisions by the EEA Joint Committee relating to the acquis,<br>the table of contents of the EEA section will contain references to where the<br>relevant internal EC texts can be found.</p>
<p>(b) EFTA data with EC relevance</p>
<p>Information emanating from the EFTA States, the EFTA Surveillance Aut-<br>hority, the Standing Committee of the EFTA States and the EFTA Court<br>regarding, for example, competition, State aid, public procurement and tech-<br>nical standards will be published in the nine official languages of the EC<br>in a special EEA section of the Official Journal of the EC.

<p>Ad Article 111</p>
<p>suspension is not in the interest of the good functioning of the Agreement<br>and all efforts should be made to avoid it;</p>

Such a conference shall be convened as soon as it has be-<br>come clear that one of the contracting Parties will not ratify the Agreement<br>or at the latest if the date of entry into force of the Agreement is not respec-<br>ted;</p>

<p>Ad Protocol 3, Article 11</p>
<p>with a view to facilitating the application of Protocol No 2 of the Free Trade<br>Agreements, the provisions of Protocol No 3 to each of these Free Trade Ag-<br>reements concerning the definition of the concept of “originating products”<br>and methods of administrative cooperation shall be amended before the<br>entry into force of the EEA Agreement. These amendments shall aim at<br>bringing the abovementioned provisions, inter alia those concerning proof<br>of origin and administrative cooperation, as much in line with those of<br>Protocol 4 of the EEA Agreement as possible while maintaining the “diago-<br>nal” cumulation system and the corresponding provisions currently appli-<br>cable in the framework of Protocol No 3.

<p>DECLARATION BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE<br>EFTA STATES ON THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL<br>SOCIAL RIGHTS FOR WORKERS</p>
<p>The Governments of the EFTA States share the view that enlarged economic<br>cooperation must be accompanied by progress in the social dimension of in-<br>tegration, to be achieved in full cooperation with the social partners. The<br>EFTA States wish to actively contribute to the development of the social di-<br>mension of the European Economic Area. They therefore welcome the<br>strengthened cooperation in the social field with the Community and its<br>Member States established under this Agreement. Recognizing the impor-<br>tance of guaranteeing, in this context, the fundamental social rights for wor-<br>kers within the whole EEA, the above mentioned Governments endorse the<br>principles and basic rights laid down in the Charter of the Fundamental So-<br>cial Rights for Workers of 9 December 1989 recalling the principle of subsi-<br>diarity referred to therein. They note that, in the implementation of such<br>rights, due regard must be given to the diversity of national practices, espe-<br>cially as regards the role of the social partners and collective agreements.</p>

<h2>DECLARATION BY THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY<br>ON THE RIGHTS OF LAWYERS OF THE EFTA STATES<br>UNDER COMMUNITY LAW</h2>

It also undertakes to<br>ensure that lawyers entitled to practise before a court of an EFTA State may<br>represent individuals and economic operators before the Court of Justice<br>and the Court of First Instance of the European Communities.</p>
<p>Such agents, advisers and lawyers shall, when they appear before the<br>Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance of the European Communi-<br>ties, enjoy the rights and immunities necessary to the independent exercise<br>of their duties, under the conditions to be laid down in the rules of procedure<br>of those Courts.</p>

The EC Commission will pursue consultations as long as<br>deemed necessary, until the Commission submits its proposal at a formal<br>meeting.</p>
<p>DECLARATION BY THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY<br>ON ARTICLE 103 OF THE EEA AGREEMENT</p>
<p>The European Community considers that until constitutional requirements<br>referred to in Article 103 (1) of the Agreement are fulfilled by the EFTA<br>States, it can delay the definitive application of the EEA Joint Committee<br>decision referred to in the same Article.</p>
<p>DECLARATION BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE<br>EFTA STATES ON ARTICLE 103 (1) OF THE EEA<br>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>Aiming to achieve a homogeneous EEA, and without prejudice to the func-<br>tioning of their democratic institutions, the EFTA States will use their best<br>endeavours to promote that the necessary constitutional requirements are<br>fulfilled as foreseen in the first subparagraph of Article 103 (1) of the EEA<br>Agreement.</p>
<p>DECLARATION BY THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY<br>ON TRANSIT IN THE FISHERIES SECTOR</p>
<p>It is the Community’s understanding that Article 6 of Protocol 9 will also be<br>applicable if a mutually satisfactory arrangement on the question of transit<br>is not found before the entry into force of the Agreement.</p>
<p>DECLARATION BY THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY<br>AND THE GOVERNMENTS OF AUSTRIA, FINLAND,<br>LIECHTENSTEIN, SWEDEN AND SWITZERLAND<br>ON WHALE PRODUCTS</p>

<p>DECLARATION BY THE GOVERNMENT OF<br>SWITZERLAND CONCERNING CUSTOMS DUTIES OF<br>A FISCAL NATURE</p>
<p>The internal procedure in view of the transformation of customs duties of a<br>fiscal nature into internal taxation has been launched.</p>
<p>Without prejudice to Protocol 5 to the Agreement, Switzerland will elimi-<br>nate these duties on the tariff positions listed in the table attached to Proto-<br>col 5, subject to the approval, according to its internal legislation, of the ne-<br>cessary constitutional and legislative modifications, at the moment when the<br>internal taxation enters into force.</p>
<p>A referendum on this subject will be held before the end of 1993.</p>
<p>In case of a positive outcome of the constitutional referendum, best efforts<br>will be undertaken in order to proceed to the transformation of customs du-<br>ties of a fiscal nature into internal taxes by the end of 1996.</p>
<p>DECLARATION BY THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY</p>
<p>The Community considers that</p>
<p>- &nbsp;the bilateral agreements on transport of goods by road and rail between<br>the European Economic Community and Austria and between the Euro-<br>pean Economic Community and Switzerland,</p>
<p>- &nbsp;the bilateral agreements on certain arrangements concerning agriculture<br>between the European Economic Community and each EFTA State,</p>
<p>- the bilateral agreements on fisheries between the European Economic<br>Community and Sweden, the European Economic Community and Nor-<br>way and the European Economic Community and Iceland,</p>
<p>notwithstanding the fact that these agreements have been laid down in se-<br>parate legal instruments, are part of the overall balance of the results of the<br>negotiations and essential elements for its approval of the EEA Agreement.</p>
<p>The Community therefore reserves its right to suspend the conclusion of<br>the EEA Agreement as long as the ratification of the above-mentioned bila-<br>teral agreements has not been notified to the Community by the EFTA Sta-<br>tes concerned. Moreover, the Community reserves its position as to the con-<br>sequences to be drawn in case of non-ratification of these agreements.</p>
<p>DECLARATION BY THE GOVERNMENT OF<br>SWITZERLAND ON THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN<br>THE EEC AND THE SWISS CONFEDERATION ON<br>THE CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY ROAD AND RAIL</p>
<p>Switzerland shall endeavour to ratify the bilateral agreement between the<br>EEC and the Swiss Confederation on carriage of goods by road and rail on<br>time for the ratification of the EEA Agreement, while confirming its posi-<br>tion that the EEAAgreement and this bilateral agreement are to be conside-<br>red as two separate legal instruments with their own merits.</p>

<p>DECLARATION BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE<br>EFTA STATES CONCERNING THE EFTA FINANCIAL<br>MECHANISM</p>
<p>The EFTA States consider that the “appropriate and equitable Solutions” re-<br>ferred to in the Joint Declaration concerning the financial mechanism should<br>have the effect either that an EFTA State acceding to the Community should<br>not be party to any financial obligation entered into by the EFTA financial<br>mechanism after that State’s accession to the Community or that a corre-<br>sponding adjustment should be made to the contributions of that State to the<br>EC general budget.</p>
<p>DECLARATION BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE<br>EFTA STATES CONCERNING A COURT OF FIRST<br>INSTANCE</p>
<p>The EFTA States will establish a court of first instance for cases in the field<br>of competition, should the need arise.</p>

<p>En domstol för EFTA-staterna, nedan kallad EFTA-domstolen, upprättas<br>härmed. Den skall fullgöra de uppgifter som följer av bestämmelserna i<br>detta avtal och i EES-avtalet.</p>
<p>Artikel 28</p>
<p>Domstolen skall bestå av sju domare.</p>
<p>Artikel 29</p>
<p>EFTA-domstolen skall sammanträda i plenum. Domstolens beslut skall<br>vara giltiga endast om ett ojämnt antal av dess ledamöter är<br>närvarande. Domstolens beslut skall vara giltiga om fem ledamöter är<br>närvarande. På domstolens begäran får EFTA-staternas regeringar i sam-<br>förstånd bemyndiga domstolen att upprätta avdelningar.</p>
<p>Artikel 30</p>
<p>Domarna skall utses bland personer vilkas oavhängighet inte kan ifrågasät-<br>tas och som i hemlandet uppfyller nödvändiga villkor för utövande av de<br>högsta domarämbetena eller är jurister med allmänt erkända<br>kvalifikationer. De skall utses för sex år av EFTA-staternas regeringar i<br>samförstånd.</p>
<p>En partiell nytillsättning av domarna skall äga rum vart tredje år. Den skall<br>gälla omväxlande tre och fyra domare. De tre domare som skall ersättas efter<br>de första tre åren skall utses genom lottning.</p>

<p>Varje fysisk eller juridisk person får på samma villkor föra talan vid EFTA-<br>domstolen mot ett beslut av EFTAzs övervakningsmyndighet som är riktat<br>till honom eller mot ett beslut riktat till en annan person, om detta direkt<br>och personligen berör honom.</p>
<p>Talan som avses i denna artikel skall anhängiggöras inom två månader från<br>dagen då åtgärden offentliggjorts eller delgivits klaganden eller, om så inte<br>skett, från den dag då denne fick kännedom om åtgärden, allt efter omstän-<br>digheterna.</p>
<p>Om talan är välgrundad, skall beslutet av EFTAzs övervakningsmyndighet<br>förklaras ogiltigt.</p>

<p>En sådan talan skall endast tas upp om EFTA:s övervakningsmyndighet<br>dessförinnan anmodats att agera. Om myndigheten inom två månader efter<br>denna anmodan inte tagit ställning, får talan anhängiggöras inom en ytterli-<br>gare frist av två månader.</p>
<p>Varje fysisk eller juridisk person får på de villkor som slagits fast i före-<br>gående stycke föra talan vid EFTA-domstolen över att EFTA:s övervak-<br>ningsmyndighet har underlåtit att rikta ett beslut till personen i fråga.</p>
<p>Artikel 38</p>
<p>Om ett beslut av EFTA:s övervakningsmyndighet har förklarats ogiltigt, el-<br>ler om det har fastställts att EFTA:s övervakningsmyndighet, i strid med<br>detta avtal eller bestämmelserna i EES-avtalet, underlåtit att agera, skall<br>EFTA:s övervakningsmyndighet vidta de åtgärder som är nödvändiga för att<br>följa domen.</p>
<p>Denna skyldighet skall inte påverka någon skyldighet som kan följa av till-<br>lämpningen av artikel 46 andra stycket.</p>
<p>Artikel 39</p>
<p>Om inte annat föreskrivs i protokoll 7 till detta avtal, skall EFTA-domstolen<br>vara behörig i mål mot EFTA:s övervakningsmyndighet avseende ersättning<br>för skada i enlighet med bestämmelserna i artikel 46 andra stycket.</p>
<p>Artikel 40</p>
<p>Talan som förs vid EFTA-domstolen skall inte hindra verkställighet. EFTA-<br>domstolen får dock, om den anser att omständigheterna så kräver, förordna<br>om uppskov med verkställigheten av den påtalade rättsakten.</p>
<p>Artikel 41</p>
<p>I ärenden som anhängiggjorts vid EFTA-domstolen får denna vidta nödvän-<br>diga interimistiska åtgärder.</p>

<p>1. Utan att det påverkar tillämpningen av artikel 31 i detta avtal kan EFTA:s<br>övervakningsmyndighet inleda det förfarande som föreliggande artikel före-<br>skriver när den, innan ett avtal har träffats, anser att en klar och konkret<br>överträdelse av bestämmelserna i EES-avtalet på upphandlingsområdet har<br>ägt rum i samband med ett upphandlingsförfarande inom tillämpningsområ-<br>det för de rättsakter som nämns i punkterna 2 och 3 i bilaga XVI i EES-<br>avtalet.</p>
<p>2. EFTA:s övervakningsmyndighet skall underrätta EFTA-staten och den<br>upphandlande enheten som berörs om skälen till varför man anser att en klar<br>och konkret överträdelse ägt rum och begära att rättelse sker.</p>
<p>3. Inom 21 dagar efter mottagande av underrättelsen enligt punkt 2 skall<br>den berörda EFTA-staten till EFTA:s övervakningsmyndighet översända:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;dess bekräftelse på att överträdelsen rättats, eller</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;en motiverad inlaga om varför ingen åtgärd vidtagits, eller</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;ett meddelande om att upphandlingsförfarandet har ställts in tills vi-<br>dare antingen av den upphandlande enheten på eget initiativ eller<br>med stöd av de befogenheter som anges i artikel 2.1.a i den rättsakt<br>som nämns i punkt 5 i bilaga XVI i EES-avtalet.</p>
<p>4. Den motiverade inlagan enligt punkt 3.b i denna artikel kan bland annat<br>grundas på det faktum att den påstådda överträdelsen redan är föremål för<br>rättsligt förfarande eller annan granskning eller översyn enligt artikel 2.8 i<br>den rättsakt som anges i punkt 5 i bilaga XVI i EES-avtalet. I så fall skall<br>EFTA-staten informera EFTA:s övervakningsmyndighet om resultaten av<br>dessa förfaranden så snart de blir kända.</p>
<p>5. När meddelande har lämnats att ett upphandlingsförfarande har ställts in<br>tills vidare enligt punkt 3.c i denna artikel skall EFTA-staten anmäla till<br>EFTA:s övervakningsmyndighet när upphandlingen återupptagits eller an-<br>nat upphandlingsförfarande inletts avseende samma ärende i dess helhet el-<br>ler del därav. Denna anmälan skall bekräfta att den påstådda överträdelsen<br>har rättats eller innefatta en motiverad inlaga om varför rättelse inte vidta-<br>gits.</p>

<p>1. Senast den 1 januari 1996 skall EFTA:s övervakningsmyndighet tillsam-<br>mans med en rådgivande kommitté, sammansatt av representanter från EF-<br>TA-staterna, granska det sätt varpå bestämmelserna i detta protokoll samt<br>bestämmelserna i den rättsakt som anges i punkt 5 i bilaga XVI i EES-avtalet</p>

<p>På ansökan av en EFTA-stat kan EFTA-staterna i samförstånd besluta att<br>stöd som denna stat lämnar eller avser att lämna skall anses vara förenligt<br>med EES-avtalets funktion, med avvikelse från bestämmelserna i artikel 61<br>i EES-avtalet, om ett sådant beslut är motiverat på grund av exceptionella<br>omständigheter. Om EFTA:s övervakningsmyndighet beträffande stödet i<br>fråga redan inlett det förfarande som anges i denna punkts första stycke,<br>skall den i de fall staten i fråga har lämnat in en ansökan till EFTA-staterna<br>skjuta upp detta förfarande tills EFTA-staterna i samförstånd har tagit ställ-<br>ning till ansökan.</p>
<p>Om EFTA-staterna inte har tagit ställning till nämnda ansökan inom tre må-<br>nader efter det att den inlämnats, skall EFTA:s övervakningsmyndighet<br>fatta beslut i ärendet.</p>
<p>3. EFTAzs övervakningsmyndighet skall underrättas i så god tid att den kan<br>yttra sig om alla planer på att vidta eller ändra stödåtgärder. Om den anser<br>att någon sådan plan inte är förenlig med EES-avtalet med avseende på arti-<br>kel 61 i EES-avtalet, skall den utan dröjsmål inleda det förfarande som anges<br>i punkt 2. Staten i fråga får inte genomföra åtgärden förrän detta förfarande<br>lett till ett slutgiltigt beslut.</p>
<p>Artikel 2</p>
<p>1. En rådgivande kommitté skall bistå EFTAzs övervakningsmyndighet vid<br>granskningen av stöd som lämnats för transporter på järnväg, landsväg och<br>inre vattenvägar. Kommittén skall som ordförande ha en representant från<br>EFTAzs övervakningsmyndighet och skall bestå av representanter utnämnda<br></p>

<p>Artikel 2</p>
<p>Icke-ingripandebesked</p>
<p>EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet kan efter ansökan av berörda företag eller<br>företagssammanslutningar fastslå att det på grundval av de omständigheter<br>som har kommit till dess kännedom inte finns anledning för den att ingripa<br>med stöd av artikel 53.1 eller artikel 54 i EES-avtalet mot ett avtal, beslut<br>eller förfarande.</p>
<p>Artikel 3</p>
<p>Åläggande att upphöra med överträdelser</p>
<p>1. Konstaterar EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet, efter ansökan eller på eget<br>initiativ, en överträdelse av bestämmelserna i artikel 53 eller artikel 54 i<br>EES-avtalet, kan den ålägga de berörda företagen eller företagssammanslut-<br>ningarna att upphöra med överträdelsen.</p>

<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;de endast syftar till</p>
<p>i) &nbsp;&nbsp;utarbetande eller enhetlig tillämpning av standarder eller ty-<br>per, eller</p>
<p>ii) &nbsp;gemensam forskning eller utveckling, eller</p>
<p>iii) &nbsp;specialisering beträffande tillverkningen av produkter, inklu-<br>sive de avtal som är nödvändiga för att genomföra denna</p>

<p>- om de berörda företagens sammanlagda årsomsättning inte<br>överstiger 200 milj. ecu.</p>
<p>Dessa avtal, beslut och samordnade förfaranden kan anmälas till EFTAs<br>övervakningsmyndighet i enlighet med artikel 56 i EES-avtalet, de regler<br>som anges i artikel 1-3 i protokoll 21 och i protokoll 23 till EES-avtalet samt<br>i kapitlen III, VI, VII, IX, X, XI, XII och XV.</p>

<p>1. EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet skall utan dröjsmål till EFTA-staternas<br>behöriga myndigheter översända kopior av ansökningar och anmälningar<br>samt även av de viktigaste handlingarna som tillställs EFTAs övervaknings-<br>myndighet för att överträdelser av artikel 53 eller 54 i EES-avtalet skall<br>kunna konstateras eller för att negativattest eller beslut om tillämpning av<br>artikel 53.3 skall kunna erhållas.</p>
<p>EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet skall utan dröjsmål till EFTA-staternas be-<br>höriga myndigheter översända kopior av anmälningar, klagomål och uppgif-<br>ter om inledande av förfaranden på eget initiativ som den har mottagit från<br>EG-kommissionen enligt artiklarna 2 och 10 i protokoll 23 till EES-avtalet.</p>

<p>2. Punkt 1 gäller även sådana fall som avses i artikel 4.2 i nämnda rättsakt.</p>
<p>3.

<p>3. Om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet inte inom 90 dagar från tidpunkten<br>för ett sådant offentliggörande i EES-delen av Europeiska gemenskapernas<br>officiella tidning meddelar sökandena att det finns allvarliga tvivel beträf-<br>fande tillämpligheten av artikel 53.3, skall avtalet, beslutet eller det samord-<br>nade förfarandet, i den mån som det överensstämmer med den beskrivning<br>som har lämnats i ansökan, anses undantaget från förbudet för den tid som<br>redan har förflutit och under ytterligare högst sex år från offentliggörandet<br>av ansökan i EES-delen av Europeiska gemenskapernas officiella tidning.</p>

<h1>DEL III KONTROLL AV</h1>
<h1>KONCENTRATIONER</h1>
<h2>KAPITEL XIII REGLER FÖR KONTROLL AV<br>FÖRETAGSKONCENTRATIONER</h2>
<p>På grund av uppdelningen av texten i förordning (EEG) nr 4064/89 mellan<br>bilaga XIV till EES-avtalet (materiella bestämmelser) och detta kapitel<br>(procedurbestämmelser) återfinns texten till artikel 1-5, med ändringar, i<br>den rättsakt som avses i punkt 1 i bilaga XIV till EES-avtalet (förordning<br>(EEG) nr 4064/89). EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet skall genomföra kon-<br>trollen av koncentrationer enligt bestämmelserna i artikel 57 i EES-avtalet,<br>särskilt punkt 2 b.</p>
<p>Artikel 1-5</p>
<p>(Ingen text)</p>
<p>Artikel 6</p>
<p>Prövning av anmälan och inledande av förfaranden</p>
<p>1. EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet skall pröva anmälan så snart den har<br>mottagits.</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;Om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet finner att den anmälda koncen-<br>trationen inte omfattas av den rättsakt som avses i punkt 1 i bilaga<br>XIV till EES-avtalet (förordning (EEG) nr4064/89), skall den fast-<br>slå detta genom beslut.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;Om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet finner att den anmälda koncen-<br>trationen, fastän den omfattas av nämnda rättsakt, inte ger anled-<br>ning till allvarliga tvivel beträffande dess förenlighet med EES-avta-<br>lets funktion, skall den besluta att inte göra invändning mot den och<br>skall förklara att den är förenlig med EES-avtalets funktion.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;Om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet däremot finner att den an-<br>mälda koncentrationen omfattas av nämnda rättsakt och ger anled-<br>ning till allvarliga tvivel beträffande dess förenlighet med EES-avta-<br>lets funktion, skall den besluta att inleda ett förfarande.</p>
<p>2. EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet skall snarast underrätta de berörda före-<br>tagen och EFTA-staternas behöriga myndigheter om sitt beslut.</p>
<p>Artikel 7</p>
<p>Uppskjutande av koncentrationer</p>
<p>1. Vid tillämpningen av punkt 2 skall en koncentration enligt artikel 1 i den<br>rättsakt som avses i punkt 1 i bilaga XIV till EES-avtalet (förordning (EEG)<br>nr 4064/89) varken genomföras före anmälan eller inom de första tre veck-<br>orna efter anmälan.</p>
<p>2. Om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet efter en preliminär prövning av an-</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 16</p>
<p>Övervakningsavtalet</p>
<p>Protokoll 4</p>

<p>mälan inom den tidsfrist som anges i punkt 1 bedömer det nödvändigt för att<br>säkerställa den fulla verkan av ett senare beslut som fattas med stöd av arti-<br>kel 8.3 och 4, kan den på eget initiativ besluta att en koncentration inte får<br>genomföras, helt eller delvis, till dess att EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet fat-<br>tar ett slutligt beslut eller att vidta andra interimistiska åtgärder med samma<br>innebörd.</p>
<p>3. Punkterna 1 och 2 skall inte utgöra hinder för genomförandet av ett of-<br>fentligt bud om övertagande som har anmälts till EFTAs övervakningsmyn-<br>dighet enligt artikel 4.1 i nämnda rättsakt före den tidpunkt när det offentlig-<br>görs, förutsatt att förvärvaren inte utövar de rösträttigheter som följer med<br>värdepapperen i fråga eller gör det endast för att upprätthålla det fulla värdet<br>av dessa investeringar och på grundval av en dispens som har lämnats av<br>EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet enligt punkt 4.</p>
<p>4. EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet kan på begäran medge dispens från de<br>skyldigheter som åläggs enligt punkterna 1, 2 eller 3 för att förhindra att ett<br>eller flera företag som berörs av en koncentration eller tredje man åsamkas<br>allvarlig skada. En sådan dispens kan förenas med villkor och ålägganden<br>för att säkerställa förutsättningarna för en effektiv konkurrens. En dispens<br>kan begäras och medges när som helst, även före anmälan eller efter transak-<br>tionen.</p>
<p>5. Giltigheten av en transaktion som genomförs i strid mot punkt 1 eller 2<br>skall vara beroende av ett beslut enligt artikel 6.1 b eller 8.2 eller 3 eller det<br>antagande som avses i artikel 10.6.</p>
<p>Denna artikel skall dock inte påverka giltigheten av transaktioner med vär-<br>depapper, inklusive sådana som kan konverteras till andra värdepapper, som<br>kan vara föremål för handel på en marknad som står under offentligt er-<br>kända myndigheters kontroll och tillsyn, som fungerar regelmässigt och som<br>direkt eller indirekt är tillgänglig för allmänheten, såvida inte köparen och<br>säljaren visste eller borde ha vetat att transaktionen genomfördes i strid mot<br>punkt 1 eller 2.</p>
<p>Artikel 8</p>
<p>EFTAs övervakningsmyndighets befogenhet att fatta beslut</p>
<p>1. Om inte annat följer av artikel 9, skall varje förfarande som inleds med<br>stöd av artikel 6.1 c avslutas genom beslut enligt punkt 2-5.</p>
<p>2. Om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet finner att en koncentration som har<br>anmälts uppfyller det kriterium som anges i artikel 2.2 i den rättsakt som<br>avses i punkt 1 i bilaga XIV till EES-avtalet (förordning (EEG) nr 4064/89),<br>eventuellt sedan de berörda företagen har vidtagit ändringar, skall den med-<br>dela ett beslut enligt vilket koncentrationen förklaras förenlig med EES-av-<br>talets funktion.</p>
<p>EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet kan förena beslutet med villkor och åläg-<br>ganden i syfte att säkerställa att de berörda företagen fullgör sina åtaganden<br>gentemot EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet när det gäller att ändra den ur-</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 16</p>
<p>Övervakningsavtalet</p>
<p>Protokoll 4</p>
<p>sprungliga koncentrationsplanen. Beslutet om att koncentrationen är fören-<br>lig med EES-avtalets funktion skall även omfatta sådana begränsningar som<br>har direkt samband med och är nödvändiga för genomförandet av koncen-<br>trationen.</p>
<p>3. Om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet finner att en koncentration uppfyller<br>det kriterium som anges i artikel 2.3 i nämnda rättsakt, skall den meddela<br>ett beslut enligt vilket koncentrationen förklaras oförenlig med EES-avtalets<br>funktion.</p>
<p>4. Om en koncentration redan har genomförts kan EFTAs övervaknings-<br>myndighet genom ett beslut enligt punkt 3 eller genom ett särskilt beslut<br>kräva att de sammanförda företagen eller tillgångarna delas upp eller att den<br>gemensamma kontrollen upphör eller att andra åtgärder som är nödvändiga<br>för att återupprätta förutsättningarna för en effektiv konkurrens vidtas.</p>
<p>5. EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet kan återkalla det beslut som den har fat-<br>tat enligt punkt 2, om</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;förklaringen om förenlighet med EES-avtalets funktion grundar sig<br>på oriktiga uppgifter för vilka ett av de berörda företagen är ansva-<br>rigt eller om den har utverkats på ett bedrägligt sätt, eller</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;de berörda företagen åsidosätter ett åläggande som var förenat med<br>beslutet.</p>
<p>6. I sådana fall som avses i punkt 5 kan EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet fatta<br>ett beslut enligt punkt 3 utan att vara bunden av den tidsfrist som avses i<br>artikel 10.3.</p>
<p>Artikel 9</p>
<p>Hänskjutande till EFTA-staternas behöriga myndigheter</p>
<p>1. EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet kan genom ett beslut som snarast medde-<br>las de berörda företagen och de övriga EFTA-staternas behöriga myndighe-<br>ter hänskjuta en anmäld koncentration till den berörda EFTA-statens behö-<br>riga myndigheter under följande omständigheter.</p>
<p>2. Inom tre veckor från det att den har mottagit en kopia av anmälan kan<br>en EFTA-stat underrätta EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet, som skall under-<br>rätta de berörda företagen, om att en koncentration hotar att skapa eller för-<br>stärka en sådan dominerande ställning som medför att den effektiva konkur-<br>rensen märkbart skulle hämmas på en marknad inom EFTA-staten som</p>
<p>uppvisar alla kännetecken på en avgränsad marknad, oavsett om det rör<br>sig om en väsentlig del av EFTA-staternas territorium.</p>
<p>3. Om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet med hänsyn till marknaden för ifrå-<br>gavarande varor och tjänster och den geografiska referensmarknaden enligt<br>definitionen i punkt 7 anser att det föreligger en sådan avgränsad marknad<br>och ett sådant hot, skall den antingen</p>
<p>a) själv behandla fallet för att upprätthålla eller återupprätta en effek-<br>tiv konkurrens på marknaden i fråga, eller</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 16</p>
<p>Övervakningsavtalet</p>
<p>Protokoll 4</p>
<p>b) hänskjuta fallet till den berörda EFTA-statens behöriga myndighe-<br>ter för att denna stats nationella konkurrenslagstiftning skall tilläm-<br>pas.</p>
<p>Om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet däremot anser att en sådan avgränsad<br>marknad eller ett sådant hot inte föreligger, skall den fatta ett beslut med<br>den innebörden som den skall rikta till den berörda EFTA-staten.</p>
<p>4. Ett beslut om hänskjutande enligt punkt 3 skall fattas</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;som huvudregel inom den sexveckorsfrist som anges i artikel 10.1<br>om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet inte har inlett ett förfarande en-<br>ligt artikel 6.1 b, eller</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;senast inom tre månader efter det att den berörda koncentrationen<br>har anmälts, om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet har inlett ett förfa-<br>rande enligt artikel 6.1c utan att ha gjort förberedelser i syfte att<br>vidta nödvändiga åtgärder enligt artikel 8.2, andra stycket, 3 eller<br>4 för att upprätthålla eller återupprätta en effektiv konkurrens på<br>marknaden i fråga.</p>
<p>5. Om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet trots påminnelse från den berörda<br>EFTA-staten inte inom den tremånadersfrist som avses i punkt 4 b har fattat<br>något beslut om hänskjutande enligt punkt 3 eller gjort de förberedelser som<br>avses i punkt 4 b, skall den anses ha beslutat att hänskjuta fallet till den be-<br>rörda EFTA-staten enligt punkt 3 b.</p>
<p>6. Rapporter om eller tillkännagivanden av resultatet av den berörda EF-<br>TA-statens behöriga myndighets undersökning av koncentrationen skall of-<br>fentliggöras senast fyra månader efter EFTAs övervakningsmyndighets hän-<br>skjutande.</p>
<p>7. Med geografisk referensmarknad skall förstås det område inom vilket de<br>berörda företagen medverkar i utbudet av varor eller tjänster, där konkur-<br>rensförhållandena är tillräckligt likartade och som kan skiljas från angrän-<br>sande områden framför allt därför att konkurrensvillkoren är väsentligt an-<br>norlunda inom de områdena. Vid denna bedömning skall hänsyn tas<br>bl. a. till de berörda varornas eller tjänsternas beskaffenhet och egenska-<br>per, eventuella hinder för inträde på marknaden, konsumentpreferenser, vä-<br>sentliga skillnader i företagens marknadsandelar inom angränsande områ-<br>den eller betydande prisskillnader.</p>
<p>8. Vid tillämpningen av denna artikel får den berörda EFTA-staten endast<br>vidta sådana åtgärder som är absolut nödvändiga för att säkerställa eller<br>återupprätta en effektiv konkurrens på marknaden i fråga.</p>
<p>9. Enligt de tillämpliga bestämmelserna i EES-avtalet kan varje EFTA-stat<br>enligt artikel 108.2 i EES-avtalet och de tillämpliga bestämmelserna i förelig-<br>gande avtal anföra besvär till EFTA-domstolen, och särskilt begära tillämp-<br>ning av artikel 41 i föreliggande avtal, för att få tillämpa sin nationella kon-<br>kurrenslagstiftning.</p>
<p>10. Denna artikel kommer att tas upp till förnyad prövning före utgången<br>av 1993.</p>

<p>Artikel 10</p>
<p>Tidsfristerna för inledande av förfaranden och för beslut</p>
<p>1. De beslut som avses i artikel 6.1 skall fattas senast inom en<br>månad. Denna frist skall löpa från dagen efter det att en anmälan har motta-<br>gits eller, om de upplysningar som skall lämnas med anmälan är ofullstän-<br>diga, från dagen efter det att de fullständiga uppgifterna har mottagits.<br>Denna frist skall förlängas till sexveckor om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet<br>mottar en begäran från en EFTA-stat enligt artikel 9.2.</p>
<p>2. Beslut enligt artikel 8.2 om anmälda koncentrationer skall fattas så snart<br>det visar sig att de allvarliga tvivel som avses i artikel 6.1c har avlägsnats,<br>särskilt till följd av ändringar som har vidtagits av de berörda företagen, och<br>senast före utgången av den frist som anges i punkt 3.</p>
<p>3. Om inte annat följer av artikel 8.6, skall beslut enligt artikel 8.3 om an-<br>mälda koncentrationer fattas inom högst fyra månader efter den tidpunkt<br>när förfarandet har inletts.</p>
<p>4. Den tidsfrist som anges i punkt 3 skall i undantagsfall tillfälligt avbrytas<br>om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet på grund av omständigheter för vilka ett<br>av de företag som deltar i koncentrationen är ansvarigt har varit tvungen att<br>begära upplysningar genom beslut enligt artikel 11 eller beordra en under-<br>sökning genom beslut enligt artikel 13.</p>
<p>5. Om domstolen avkunnar en dom som helt eller delvis upphäver ett beslut<br>av EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet enligt detta kapitel, skall de tidsfrister<br>som anges i detta kapitel börja löpa på nytt från dagen när domen avkunna-<br>des.</p>
<p>6. Om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet inte har fattat något beslut enligt ar-<br>tikel 6.1 b eller c eller artikel 8.2 eller 3 inom de tidsfrister som anges i punkt<br>1 respektive punkt 3, skall koncentrationen anses ha förklarats förenlig med<br>EES-avtalets funktion, om inte annat följer av artikel 9.</p>

I sådana fall skall anmälan gälla från den dag när de fullständiga<br>uppgifterna har inkommit till EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet.</p>
<p>3. EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet kan ge dispens från skyldigheten att<br>lämna vissa uppgifter som begärs i det formulär som för detta ändamål utfär-<br>das av EFTA-staternas regeringar enligt gemensam överenskommelse eller<br>av EG-kommissionen, om den anser att dessa uppgifter inte behövs för ären-<br>dets prövning.</p>

<p>Artikel 5</p>
<p>Omvandling av anmälningar</p>
<p>1. Om EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet konstaterar att den anmälda trans-<br>aktionen inte utgör en koncentration enligt artikel 3 i den rättsakt som avses<br>i punkt 1 i bilaga XIV till EES-avtalet (förordning (EEG) nr 4064/89), skall<br>den skriftligt underrätta anmälarna eller den gemensamma ställföreträdaren<br>om detta.

EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet får i enlighet med artikel 3 inhämta alla<br>uppgifter som behövs för tillämpningen av artikel 1 i protokoll 25 till EES-<br>avtalet och av denna artikel, antingen genom en särskild begäran till de be-<br>rörda parterna eller genom beslut som anger vilka slags avtal, beslut eller<br>förfaranden som skall anmälas.</p>
<p>5. EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet är, med förbehåll för rätten att föra talan<br>vid EFTA-domstolen enligt artikel 108.2 i EES-avtalet och de tillämpliga be-<br>stämmelserna i föreliggande avtal, ensam behörig att i enlighet med de vill-<br>kor som anges i artikel 55 i EES-avtalet samt protokollen 22 och 25 till avta-<br>let avgöra om sådana avtal eller beslut står i överensstämmelse med artikel<br>1 i protokoll 25 till EES-avtalet.</p>
<p>6. EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet får ålägga ett företag böter eller viten om<br>det har ingått ett avtal som automatiskt är ogiltigt enligt artikel 1.3 i proto-<br>koll 25 till EES-avtalet eller om det genom skiljedomsförfarande, avtalsvite,<br>bojkott eller på något annat sätt har tillämpat, eller försökt tillämpa, ett avtal<br>eller beslut som automatiskt är ogiltigt eller ett avtal för vilket godkännande<br>har vägrats eller återkallats eller har utverkat ett godkännande genom med-<br>vetet oriktiga eller vilseledande uppgifter eller har deltagit i förfaranden som<br>är förbjudna enligt artikel 1.1 i protokoll 25 till EES-avtalet. Det högsta bo-<br>tes- eller vitesbeloppet får inte överstiga det dubbla värdet av omsättningen<br>för de varor som berörs av det i artikel 1.1 i protokoll 25 till EES-avtalet<br>förbjudna avtalet, beslutet eller förfarandet. Om syftet med avtalet, beslutet<br>eller förfarandet har varit att begränsa produktion, teknisk utveckling eller<br>investeringar, kan detta belopp dock höjas, vad gäller böter, till 10 procent<br>av det berörda företagets årsomsättning och, vad gäller viten, till 20 procent<br>av dagsomsättningen.</p>

<p>Artikel 2</p>
<p>1. Vid bedömningen av huruvida kraven i artikel 2.2 i protokoll 25 till EES-<br>avtalet är uppfyllda skall EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet, i överensstäm-<br>melse med principen om icke-diskriminering, ta hänsyn till storleken på lik-<br>nande företag inom det territorium som omfattas av EES-avtalet i den ut-<br>sträckning som den anser det motiverat för att undvika eller utjämna de<br>nackdelar som har uppkommit till följd av skillnader i konkurrensvillkoren.</p>
<p>2. EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet får uppställa de villkor för godkännandet<br>som den anser nödvändiga för att uppnå syftet med artikel 2.2 i protokoll 25<br>till EES-avtalet.</p>
<p>3. Innan EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet tar ställning till en transaktion som<br>berör företag av vilka minst ett inte omfattas av artikel 3 i protokoll 25 till<br>EES-avtalet, skall den inhämta de berörda regeringarnas synpunkter.</p>
<p>4. Om inte annat följer av tillämpningen av artikel 3 på företag som lyder<br>under EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet, får denna från de fysiska eller juri-<br>diska personer som har förvärvat eller sammanslagit, eller avser att förvärva<br>eller sammanslå, ifrågavarande rättigheter eller tillgångar inhämta alla de<br>uppgifter som behövs för tillämpningen av artikel 2 i protokoll 25 till EES-<br>avtalet och av föreliggande artikel beträffande transaktioner som kan leda<br>till det resultat som avses i artikel 2.1 i protokoll 25 till EES-avtalet.</p>
<p>5. Om en koncentration har kommit till stånd beträffande vilken EFTAs<br>övervakningsmyndighet konstaterar att den har genomförts i strid med be-<br>stämmelserna i artikel 2.1 i protokoll 25 till EES-avtalet men trots detta upp-<br>fyller kraven i artikel 2.2 i protokoll 25 till EES-avtalet, skall den godkänna<br>koncentrationen endast under förutsättning att de personer som har förvär-<br>vat eller sammanslagit ifrågavarande rättigheter eller tillgångar erlägger bö-<br>ter enligt punkt 12 b. Om det är uppenbart att ett godkännande borde ha<br>sökts, skall bötesbeloppet inte understiga hälften av det högsta belopp som</p>
<p>anges i punkt 12 b. Erläggs inte detta belopp, skall EFTAs övervaknings-<br>myndighet vidta de åtgärder som anges nedan i fråga om koncentrationer<br>som befinns vara otillåtna.</p>
<p>6. Om en koncentration har kommit till stånd beträffande vilken EFTAs<br>övervakningsmyndighet konstaterar att de allmänna eller särskilda villkor<br>som har uppställts för ett godkännaNde enligt artikel 2.2 i protokoll 25 till<br>EES-avtalet inte är uppfyllda, skall EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet genom<br>ett motiverat beslut förklara att koncentrationen är otillåten och, efter ha<br>gett de berörda parterna tillfälle att framföra sina synpunkter, förordna om<br>uppdelning av de sammanförda företagen eller tillgångarna eller om upphö-<br>rande av den gemensamma kontrollen samt om vidtagande av alla andra åt-<br>gärder som den anser nödvändiga för att de berörda företagen åter skall dri-<br>vas eller tillgångarna utnyttjas självständigt och för att återupprätta normala<br>konkurrensvillkor. Vaije direkt berörd person kan i enlighet med artikel<br>108.2b i EES-avtalet och artikel 18 i föreliggande avtal föra talan mot sådana<br>beslut. EFTA-domstolen har enligt artikel 108.2 i EES-avtalet och de till-<br>lämpliga bestämmelserna i föreliggande avtal oinskränkt rätt att pröva huru-</p>

<p>vida den genomförda transaktionen utgör en koncentration enligt artikel 2.1<br>i protokoll 25 till EES-avtalet och de rättsakter om kol och stål som anges i<br>bilaga XIV till EES-avtalet. Väckande av sådan talan skall medföra att be-<br>slutet skjuts upp. Talan får endast väckas efter det att ovannämnda åtgärder<br>har påbjudits, såvida inte EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet samtycker till att<br>särskild talan väcks mot det beslut genom vilket transaktionen har förklarats<br>otillåten.</p>
<p>7. EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet kan när som helst, med förbehåll för till-<br>lämpning av artikel 41 i EES-avtalet, vidta eller föranstalta om sådana före-<br>byggande interimsåtgärder som den anser nödvändiga för att skydda kon-<br>kurrerande företags eller tredje mans intressen samt för att avvärja varje åt-<br>gärd som skulle kunna hindra att dess beslut verkställs. Om inte EFTA-dom-<br>stolen beslutar annorlunda, skall talan inte medföra anstånd i fråga om så-<br>dana interimsåtgärder.</p>
<p>8. EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet skall medge de berörda parterna en skä-<br>lig frist för att efterkomma dess beslut. Efter utgången av denna frist får den<br>förelägga dagsviten om högst en tiondel av 1 % av värdet av ifrågavarande<br>rättigheter eller tillgångar.</p>
<p>9. Om de berörda parterna inte uppfyller sina skyldigheter, skall EFTAs<br>övervakningsmyndighet dessutom själv vidta åtgärder för att få sitt beslut<br>verkställt.</p>
<p>10. EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet har dessutom befogenhet att rikta så-<br>dana rekommendationer till de berörda EFTA-staterna som kan behövas för<br>att säkerställa att de åtgärder som avses i föregående stycken verkställs inom<br>ramen för deras nationella lagstiftning.</p>
<p>11. Vid utövandet av sina befogenheter skall EFTAs övervakningsmyndig-<br>het beakta de rättigheter som tredje man har förvärvat i god tro.</p>
<p>12. EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet kan ålägga böter till ett belopp som inte<br>överstiger</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;3 procent av värdet av de tillgångar som har förvärvats eller sam-<br>manslagits, eller som skall förvärvas eller sammanslås, för fysiska<br>eller juridiska personer som har undandragit sig de skyldigheter som<br>anges i punkt 4,</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;10 procent av värdet av de tillgångar som har förvärvats eller sam-<br>manslagi ts för fysiska eller juridiska personer som har undandragit<br>sig de skyldigheter som anges i artikel 2.1 i protokoll 25 till EES-<br>avtalet, varvid detta maximibelopp efter utgången av tolfte måna-<br>den efter det att transaktionen har genomförts skall höjas med en<br>tjugofjärdedel för vaije ytterligare månad som förflyter till dess att<br>EFTAs övervakningsmyndighet fastställer att en överträdelse har<br>skett,</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;10 procent av värdet av de tillgångar som har förvärvats eller sam-<br>manslagits, eller som skall förvärvas eller sammanslås, för fysiska<br>eller juridiska personer som genom oriktiga eller vilseledande upp-</p>

In such a case, the EFTA State shall inform the EFTA<br>Surveillance Authority of the result of those proceedings as soon as it be-<br>comes known.</p>

<p>If the EFTA State concerned does not comply with this decision within the<br>prescribed time, the EFTA Surveillance Authority or any other interested<br>EFTA State may, in derogation from Articles 31 and 32 of this Agreement,<br>refer the matter to the EFTA Court directly.</p>
<p>On application by an EFTA State, the EFTA States may, by common ac-<br>cord, decide that aid which that State is granting or intends to grant shall be<br>considered to be compatible with the functioning of the EEA Agreement, in<br>derogation from the provisions of Article 61 of the EEA Agreement, if such<br>a decision is justified by exceptional circumstances. If, as regards the aid in<br>question, the EFTA Surveillance Authority has already initiated the<br>procedure provided for in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the fact<br>that the State concerned has made its application to the EFTA States shall<br>have the effect of suspending that procedure until the EFTA States, by com-<br>mon accord, have made their attitude known.</p>
<p>If, however, the EFTA States have not made their attitude known within<br>three months of the said application being made, the EFTA Surveillance<br>Authority shall give its decision on the case.</p>

<p>(a) &nbsp;the agreement, decision or concerted practice in question does not<br>impose upon the undertakings concerned any restriction not indis-<br>pensable to the reduction of disturbances; and</p>
<p>(b) does not make it possible for such undertakings to eliminate com-<br>petition in respect of a substantial part of the transport market con-<br>cerned.</p>

<p>Article 10</p>
<p>Procedures on complaint or on the EFTA Surveillance Authority’s own<br>initiative</p>
<p>Acting on receipt of a complaint or on its own initiative, the EFTA Surveil-<br>lance Authority shall initiate procedures to terminate any infringement of<br>the provisions of Article 2 or Article 8 of the act referred to in point 10 of<br>Annex XIV to the EEA Agreement (Regulation (EEC) No 1017/68) or to<br>enforce Article 4(2) of that act.</p>
<p>Complaints may be submitted by:</p>
<p>(a) EFTA States;</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;natural or legal persons who claim a legitimate interest.</p>
<p>Article 11</p>
<p>Result of procedures on complaint or on the EFTA Surveillance Authority’s<br>own initiative</p>
<p>1. Where the EFTA Surveillance Authority finds that there has been an in-<br>fringement of Article 2 or Article 8 of the act referred to in point 10 of Annex<br>XIV to the EEA Agreement (Regulation (EEC) No 1017/68), it may by de-<br>cision require the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned to<br>bring such infringement to an end.</p>
<p>Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Chapter and the said act,<br>the EFTA Surveillance Authority may, before taking a decision under the<br>preceding subparagraph, address to the undertakings or associations of un-<br>dertakings concerned recommendations for termination of the infringement.</p>
<p>2. Paragraph 1 shall apply also to cases falling within Article 4(2) of the said<br>act.</p>
<p>3. If the EFTA Surveillance Authority, acting on a complaint received, con-<br>cludes that on the evidence before it there are no grounds for intervention<br>under Article 2, Article 4(2) or Article 8 of the said act in respect of any<br>agreement, decision or concerted practice, it shall issue a decision rejecting<br>the complaint as unfounded.</p>
<p>4. If the EFTA Surveillance Authority, whether acting on a complaint re-<br>ceived or on its own initiative, concludes that an agreement, decision or<br>concerted practice satisfies the provisions both of Article 2 and of Article 5<br>of the said act, it shall issue a decision applying Article 5. Such decision shall<br>indicate the date from which it is to take effect. This date may be prior to<br>that of the decision.</p>

<p>2. If the EFTA Surveillance Authority judges an application admissible and<br>is in possession of all the available evidence, and no action under Article 10<br>has been taken against the agreement, decision or concerted practice in<br>question, then it shall publish as soon as possible in the EEA Section of the<br>Official Journal of the European Communities a summary of the application<br>and invite all interested third parties to submit their comments to the EFTA<br>Surveillance Authority within 30 days.

Unless the EFTA Surveillance Authority notifies applicants, within<br>90 days from the date of such publication in the EEA Section of the Official<br>Journal of the European Communities, that there are serious doubts as to<br>the applicability of Article 5 of the said act, the agreement, decision or<br>concerted practice shall be deemed exempt, in so far as it conforms with the<br>description given in the application, from the prohibition for the time al-<br>ready elapsed and for a maximum of three years from the date of publication<br>in the EEA Section of the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>
<p>If the EFTA Surveillance Authority finds, after expiry of the 90-day time-<br>limit, but before expiry of the three-year period, that the conditions for ap-<br>plying Article 5 of the said act are not satisfied, it shall issue a decision declar-<br>ing that the prohibition in Article 2 of the said act is applicable. Such decision<br>may be retroactive where the parties concerned have given inaccurate in-<br>formation or where they abuse the exemption from the provisions of<br>Article 2 of the said act.</p>
<p>4. If, within the 90-day time-limit, the EFTA Surveillance Authority notifies<br>applicants as referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 3, it shall ex-<br>amine whether the provisions of Article 2 and of Article 5 of the said act are<br>satisfied.</p>
<p>If it finds that the provisions of Article 2 and of Article 5 of the said act are<br>satisfied it shall issue a decision applying Article 5. The decision shall indic-<br>ate the date from which it is to take effect. This date may be prior to that of<br>the application.</p>

<p>Inquiries into transport sectors</p>
<p>1. If trends in transport, fluctuations in or inflexibility of transport rates, or<br>other circumstances, suggest that competition in transport is being restricted<br>or distorted within the territory covered by the EEA Agreement in a specific<br>geographical area, or over one or more transport links, or in respect of the<br>carriage of passengers or goods belonging to one or more specific categories,<br>the EFTA Surveillance Authority may decide, in accordance with the provi-<br>sions of Protocol 23 to the EEA Agreement, to conduct a general inquiry<br>into the sector concerned, in the course of which it may request transport<br>undertakings in that sector to supply the information and documentation<br>necessary for giving effect to the principles formulated in Articles 2 to 5, 7<br>and 8 of the act referred to in point 10 of Annex XIV to the EEA Agreement<br>(Regulation (EEC) No 1017/68) and to Article 6 of this Chapter.</p>

<p>1. Where the EFTA Surveillance Authority finds that there has been an in-<br>fringement of Articles 53( 1) or 54 of the EEA Agreement, it may by decision<br>require the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned to bring<br>such infringement to an end.</p>
<p>Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Chapter or to the provi-<br>sions of the act referred to in point 11 of Annex XIV to the EEA Agreement<br>(Regulation (EEC) No4056/86), the EFTA Surveillance Authority may, be-<br>fore taking a decision under the preceding subparagraph, address to the un-<br>dertakings or associations of undertakings concerned recommendations for<br>termination of the infringement.</p>
<p>2. Paragraph 1 shall apply also to cases falling within Article 7 of the said<br>act.</p>

<p>2. If the EFTA Surveillance Authority judges an application admissible and<br>is in possession of all the available evidence, and no action under Article 10<br>has been taken against the agreement, decision or concerted practice in<br>question, then it shall publish as soon as possible in the EEA Section of the<br>Official Journal of the European Communities a summary of the application<br>and invite all interested third parties and the EFTA States to submit their<br>comments to the EFTA Surveillance Authority within 30 days.

<p>If the EFTA Surveillance Authority finds, after expiry of the 90-day time-<br>limit, but before expiry of the six-year period, that the conditions for apply-<br>ing Article 53(3) are not satisfied, it shall issue a decision declaring that the<br>prohibition in Article 53(1) is applicable.

This request must be justified on<br>the basis of considerations relating to the competition rules of the EEA<br>Agreement.</p>
<p>If it finds that the conditions of Article 53(1) and of Article 53(3) are satis-<br>fied, the EFTA Surveillance Authority shall issue a decision applying<br>Article 53(3). The decision shall indicate the date from which it is to take<br>effect. This date may be prior to that of the application.</p>

<p>Scope</p>

<p>2. This Chapter shall apply only to international air transport between air-<br>ports within the territory covered by the EEA Agreement.</p>
<p>Article 2</p>
<p>Exceptions for certain technical agreements</p>
<p>1. The prohibition laid down in Article 53(1) of the EEA Agreement shall<br>not apply to the agreements, decisions and concerted practices listed in Ap-<br>pendix 7 to this Protocol, in so far as their sole object and effect is to achieve<br>technical improvements or cooperation. This list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p>2. If necessary, the EFTA Surveillance Authority may submit to the Gov-<br>ernments of the EFTA States, in accordance with the provisions of Article 49<br>of this Agreement, proposals for the amendment of the list in Appendix 7.</p>
<p>Article 3</p>
<p>Procedures on complaint or on the EFTA Surveillance Authority’s own<br>initiative</p>
<p>1. Acting on receipt of a complaint or on its own initiative, the EFTA Sur-<br>veillance Authority shall initiate procedures to terminate any infringement<br>of the provisions of Articles 53(1) or 54 of the EEA Agreement.</p>
<p>Complaints may be submitted by:</p>

<p>(a) EFTA States;</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;natural or legal persons who claim a legitimate interest.</p>
<p>2. Upon application by the undertakings or associations of undertakings<br>concerned, the EFTA Surveillance Authority may certify that, on the basis<br>of the facts in its possession, there are no grounds under Article 53(1) or<br>Article 54 of the EEA Agreement for action on its part in respect of an agree-<br>ment, decision or concerted practice.</p>
<p>Article 4</p>
<p>Result of procedures on complaint or on the EFTA Surveillance<br>Authority’s own initiative</p>
<p>1. Where the EFTA Surveillance Authority finds that there has been an in-<br>fringement of Articles 53(1) or 54 of the EEA Agreement, it may by decision<br>require the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned to bring<br>such an infringement to an end.</p>
<p>Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Chapter, the EFTA Sur-<br>veillance Authority may address recommendations for termination of the in-<br>fringement to the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned<br>before taking a decision under the preceding subparagraph.</p>
<p>2. If the EFTA Surveillance Authority, acting on a complaint received, con-<br>cludes that, on the evidence before it, there are no grounds for intervention<br>under Articles 53(1) or 54 of the EEA Agreement in respect of any agree-<br>ment, decision or concerted practice, it shall take a decision rejecting the<br>complaint as unfounded.</p>
<p>3. If the EFTA Surveillance Authority, whether acting on a complaint re-<br>ceived or on its own initiative concludes that an agreement, decision or<br>concerted practice satisfies the provisions of both Article 53(1) and 53(3) of<br>the EEA Agreement, it shall take a decision applying paragraph 3 of the said<br>Article. Such a decision shall indicate the date from which it is to take effect.<br>This date may be prior to that of the decision.</p>
<p>Article 4a</p>
<p>Interim measures against anti-competitive practices</p>
<p>1. Without prejudice to the application of Article 4(1), where the EFTA<br>Surveillance Authority has clear prima facie evidence that certain practices<br>are contrary to Article 53 or 54 of the EEA Agreement and have the object<br>or effect of directly jeopardizing the existence of an air service, and where<br>recourse to normal procedures may not be sufficient to protect the air service<br>or the airline company concerned, it may by decision take interim measures<br>to ensure that these practices are not implemented or cease to be imple-<br>mented and give such instructions as are necessary to prevent the occurrence<br>of these practices until a decision under Article 4(1) is taken.</p>
<p>2. A decision taken pursuant to paragraph 1 shall apply for a period not ex-<br>ceeding six months. Article 8(5) shall not apply.</p>

<p>2. If the EFTA Surveillance Authority judges an application admissible and<br>is in possession of all the available evidence and no action under Article 3<br>has been taken against the agreement, decision or concerted practice in<br>question, then it shall publish as soon as possible in the EEA Section of the<br>Official Journal of the European Communities a summary of the application<br>and invite all interested third parties and the EFTA States to submit their<br>comments to the EFTA Surveillance Authority within 30 days.

Unless the EFTA Surveillance Authority notifies applicants, within 90<br>days of the date of such publication in the EEA Section of the Official<br>Journal of the European Communities, that there are serious doubts as to<br>the applicability of Article 53(3) of the EEA Agreement, the agreement, de-<br>cision or concerted practice shall be deemed exempt, in so far as it conforms<br>with the description given in the application, from the prohibition for the<br>time already elapsed and for a maximum of six years from the date of pub-<br>lication in the EEA Section of the Official Journal of the European Commu-<br>nities.</p>
<p>If the EFTA Surveillance Authority finds, after expiry of the 90-day time-<br>limit, but before expiry of the six-year period, that the conditions for apply-<br>ing Article 53(3) of the EEA Agreement are not satisfied, it shall issue a de-<br>cision declaring that the prohibition in Article 53(1) applies. Such decision<br>may be retroactive where the parties concerned have given inaccurate in-<br>formation or where they abuse an exemption from the provisions of<br>Article 53(1) or have contravened Article 54.</p>
<p>4. The EFTA Surveillance Authority may notify applicants as referred to in<br>the first subparagraph of paragraph 3; it shall do so if requested by an EFTA<br>State within 45 days of the forwarding to the EFTA State of the application<br>in accordance with Article 8(2). This request must be justified on the basis<br>of considerations relating to the competition rules of the EEA Agreement.</p>
<p>If it finds that the conditions of Article 53(1) and (3) of the EEA Agree-<br>ment are satisfied, the EFTA Surveillance Authority shall issue a decision<br>applying Article 53(3). The decision shall indicate the date from which it is<br>to take effect. This date may be prior to that of the application.</p>

<p>Fines</p>
<p>1. The EFTA Surveillance Authority may, by decision, impose fines on un-<br>dertakings or associations of undertakings of from 100 to 5 000 ECU where,<br>intentionally or negligently:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;they supply incorrect or misleading information in connection with<br>an application pursuant to Article 3(2) or Article 5; or</p>
<p>(b) they supply incorrect information in response to a request made pur-<br>suant to Article 9(3) or (5), or do not supply information within the<br>time-limit fixed by a decision adopted under Article 9(5); or</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;they produce the required books or other business records in incom-<br>plete form during investigations under Article 10 or Article 11, or re-<br>fuse to submit to an investigation ordered by decision taken pursu-<br>ant to Article 11(3).</p>
<p>2. The EFTA Surveillance Authority may, by decision, impose fines on un-<br>dertakings or associations of undertakings of from 1 000 to 1000 000 ECU,<br>or a sum in excess thereof, but not exceeding 10% of the turnover in the<br>preceding business year of the undertakings participating in the infringe-<br>ment, where either intentionally or negligently they:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;infringe Article 53(1) or Article 54 of the EEA Agreement; or</p>
<p>(b) commit a breach of any obligation imposed pursuant to Article 6(1)<br>of this Chapter.</p>

<p>However, this provision shall not have effect where the EFTA Surveil-<br>lance Authority has informed the undertakings or associations of undertak-<br>ings concerned that, after preliminary examination, it is of the opinion that<br>Article 53(1) of the EEA Agreement applies and that application of<br>Article53(3) is not justified.</p>

<p>(e) to comply with any measure imposed by decision taken under<br>Article 4a.</p>
<p>2. When the undertakings or associations of undertakings have satisfied the<br>obligation which it was the purpose of the periodic penalty payment to en-<br>force, the EFTA Surveillance Authority may fix the total amount of the peri-<br>odic penalty payment at a lower figure than that which would result from the<br>original decision.</p>
<p>3. Article 8 shall apply.</p>

<p>The EFTA Court, in accordance with Article 108(2) of the EEA Agreement<br>and with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, shall have unlimited jur-<br>isdiction within the meaning of Article 35 of this Agreement to review de-<br>cisions whereby the EFTA Surveillance Authority has fixed a fine or periodic<br>penalty payment; it may cancel, reduce or increase the fine or periodic pen-<br>alty payment imposed.</p>

<h1>PART III CONTROL OF</h1>
<h1>CONCENTRATIONS</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII RULES RELATING TO CONTROL<br>OF CONCENTRATIONS BETWEEN UNDERTAKINGS</h2>
<p>Due to the division of the text of Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 between Annex<br>XIV to the EEA Agreement (substantive rules) and the present Chapter<br>(procedural rules), the text, as adapted, of Articles 1 to 5 is to be found in the<br>act referred to in point 1 of Annex XIV to the EEA Agreement (Regulation<br>(EEC) No 4064/89). The EFTA Surveillance Authority shall carry out the<br>control of concentration in accordance with the provisions of Article 57 of the<br>EEA Agreement, in particularparagraph 2(b).</p>
<p>Articles 1 to 5</p>
<p>(No text)</p>
<p>Article 6</p>
<p>Examination of the notification and initiation of proceedings</p>
<p>1. The EFTA Surveillance Authority, in accordance with the provisions of<br>Article 57(1) and (2)(b) of the EEAAgreement, shall examine the notifica-<br>tion as soon as it is received.</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;Where it concludes that the concentration notified does not fall<br>within the scope of the act referred to in point 1 of Annex XIV to<br>the EEAAgreement (Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89), it shall record<br>that finding by means of a decision.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;Where it finds that the concentration notified, although falling<br>within the scope of the said act, does not raise serious doubts as to its<br>compatibility with the functioning of the EEA Agreement, it shall<br>decide not to oppose it and shall declare that it is compatible with<br>the functioning of the EEA Agreement.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;If, on the other hand, it finds that the concentration notified falls<br>within the scope of the said act and raises serious doubts as to its<br>compatibility with the functioning of the EEA Agreement, it shall<br>decide to initiate proceedings.</p>
<p>2. The EFTA Surveillance Authority shall notify its decision to the under-<br>takings concerned and the competent authorities of the EFTA States without<br>delay.</p>
<p>Article 7</p>
<p>Suspension of concentrations</p>
<p>1. For the purposes of paragraph 2 a concentration as defined in Article 1 of<br>the act referred to in point 1 of Annex XIV to the EEAAgreement (Regula-<br>tion (EEC) No 4064/89) shall not be put into effect either before its notifica-<br>tion or within the first three weeks following its notification.</p>
<p>Prop. 1991/92:170</p>
<p>Bilaga 16</p>
<p>ESA/Court</p>
<p>Agreement</p>
<p>Protocol 4</p>
<p>255</p>
<p>2. Where the EFTA Surveillance Authority, following a preliminary exam-<br>ination of the notification within the period provided for in paragraph 1,<br>finds it necessary in order to ensure the full effectiveness of any decision<br>taken later pursuant to Article 8(3) and (4), it may decide on its own initiat-<br>ive to continue the suspension of a concentration in whole or in part until it<br>takes a final decision, or to take other interim measures to that effect.</p>
<p>3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not impede the implementation of a public bid<br>which has been notified to the EFTA Surveillance Authority in accordance<br>with Article 4(1) of the said act, provided that the acquirer does not exercise<br>the voting rights attached to the securities in question or does so only to<br>maintain the full value of those investments and on the basis of a derogation<br>granted by the EFTA Surveillance Authority pursuant to paragraph 4.</p>
<p>4. The EFTA Surveillance Authority may, on request, grant a derogation<br>from the obligations imposed in paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 in order to prevent ser-<br>ious damage to one or more undertakings concerned by a concentration or<br>to a third party. That derogation may be made subject to conditions and ob-<br>ligations in order to ensure conditions of effective competition. A derogation<br>may be applied for and granted at any time, even before notification or after<br>the transaction.</p>
<p>5. The validity of any transaction carried out in contravention of paragraph<br>1 or 2 shall be dependent on a decision pursuant to Article 6( 1)(b) or 8(2) or<br>(3) or on a presumption pursuant to Article 10(6).</p>
<p>This Article shall, however, have no effect on the validity of transactions<br>in securities including those convertible into other securities admitted to<br>trading on a market which is regulated and supervised by authorities recog-<br>nized by public bodies, operates regularly and is accessible directly or<br>indirectly to the public, unless the buyer and seller knew or ought to have<br>known that the transaction was carried out in contravention of paragraph 1<br>or 2.</p>
<p>Article 8</p>
<p>Powers of decision of the EFTA Surveillance Authority</p>
<p>1. Without prejudice to Article 9, all proceedings initiated pursuant to<br>Article 6(l)(c) shall be closed by means of a decision as provided for in para-<br>graphs 2 to 5.</p>
<p>2. Where the EFTA Surveillance Authority finds that, following modifica-<br>tion by the undertakings concerned if necessary, a notified concentration ful-<br>fils the criterion laid down in Article 2(2) of the act referred to in point 1 of<br>Annex XIV to the EEAAgreement (Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89), it shall<br>issue a decision declaring the concentration compatible with the functioning<br>of the EEA Agreement.</p>
<p>It may attach to its decision conditions and obligations intended to ensure<br>that the undertakings concerned comply with the commitments they have<br>entered into vis-ä-vis the EFTA Surveillance Authority with a view to modi-</p>

<p>Bilaga 16</p>
<p>ESA/Court</p>
<p>Agreement</p>
<p>Protocol4</p>
<p>256</p>
<p>fying the original concentration plan. The decision declaring the concentra-<br>tion compatible shall also cover restrictions directly related and necessary to<br>the implementation of the concentration.</p>
<p>3. Where the EFTA Surveillance Authority finds that a concentration fulfils<br>the criterion laid down in Article 2(3) of the said act, it shall issue a decision<br>declaring that the concentration is incompatible with the functioning of the<br>EEA Agreement.</p>
<p>4. Where a concentration has already been implemented, the EFTA Sur-<br>veillance Authority may, in a decision pursuant to paragraph 3 or by separate<br>decision, require the undertakings or assets brought together to be separated<br>or the cessation of joint control or any other action that may be appropriate<br>in order to restore conditions of effective competition.</p>
<p>5. The EFTA Surveillance Authority may revoke the decision it has taken<br>pursuant to paragraph 2 where:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;the declaration of compatibility is based on incorrect information for<br>which one of the undertakings is responsible or where it has been<br>obtained by deceit; or</p>
<p>(b) the undertakings concerned commit a breach of an obligation at-<br>tached to the decision.</p>
<p>6. In the case referred to in paragraph 5, the EFTA Surveillance Authority<br>may take a decision under paragraph 3, without being bound by the deadline<br>referred to in Article 10(3).</p>
<p>Article 9</p>
<p>Referral to the competent authorities of the EFTA States</p>
<p>1. The EFTA Surveillance Authority may, by means of a decision notified<br>without delay to the undertakings concerned and the competent authorities<br>of the other EFTA States, refer a notified concentration to the competent<br>authorities of the EFTA State concerned in the following circumstances.</p>
<p>2. Within three weeks of the date of receipt of the copy of the notification<br>an EFTA State may inform the EFTA Surveillance Authority which shall<br>inform the undertakings concerned that a concentration threatens to create<br>or to strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competi-<br>tion would be significantly impeded on a market, within that State, which<br>presents all the characteristics of a distinct market, be it a substantial part of<br>the territory of the EFTA States or not.</p>
<p>3. If the EFTA Surveillance Authority considers that, having regard to the<br>market for the products or services in question and the geographical refer-<br>ence market within the meaning of paragraph 7, there is such a distinct mar-<br>ket and that such a threat exists, either:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;it shall itself deal with the case in order to maintain or restore effect-<br>ive competition on the market concerned; or</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;it shall refer the case to the competent authorities of the EFTA State</p>

<p>concerned with a view to the application of that Statc’s national<br>competition law.</p>
<p>If, however, the EFTA Surveillance Authority considers that such a distinct<br>market or threat does not exist it shall adopt a decision to that effect which<br>it shall address to the EFTA State concerned.</p>
<p>4. A decision to refer or not to refer pursuant to paragraph 3 shall be taken<br>where:</p>
<p>(a) as a general rule within the six-week period provided for in<br>Article 10(1), second paragraph, where the EFTA Surveillance<br>Authority, pursuant to Article 6(l)(b), has not initiated proceed-<br>ings; or</p>
<p>(b) within three months at most of the notification of the concentration<br>concerned where the EFTA Surveillance Authority has initiated<br>proceedings under Article 6(l)(c), without taking the preparatory<br>steps in order to adopt the necessary measures under Article 8(2),<br>second subparagraph, (3) or (4) to maintain or restore effective<br>competition on the market concerned.</p>
<p>5. If within the three months referred to in paragraph 4(b) the EFTA Sur-<br>veillance Authority, despite a reminder from the EFTA State concerned, has<br>not taken a decision on referral in accordance with paragraph 3 nor has taken<br>the preparatory steps referred to in paragraph 4(b), it shall be deemed to<br>have taken a decision to refer the case to the EFTA State concerned in ac-<br>cordance with paragraph 3(b).</p>
<p>6. The publication of any report or the announcement of the findings of the<br>examination of the concentration by the competent authority of the EFTA<br>State concerned shall be effected not more than four months after the EFTA<br>Surveillance Authority’s referral.</p>
<p>7. The geographical reference market shall consist of the area in which the<br>undertakings concerned are involved in the supply and demand of products<br>or services, in which the conditions of competition are sufficiently homogen-<br>eous and which can be distinguished from neighbouring areas because, in<br>particular, conditions of competition are appreciably different in those areas.<br>This assessment should take account in particular of the nature and charac-<br>teristics of the products or services concerned, of the existence of entry bar-<br>riers or of consumer preferences, of appreciable differences of the undertak-<br>ings’ market shares between the area concerned and neighbouring areas or<br>of substantial price differences.</p>
<p>8. In applying the provisions of this Article, the EFTA State concerned may<br>take only the measures strictly necessary to safeguard or restore effective<br>competition on the market concerned.</p>
<p>9. In accordance with the relevant provisions of the EEA Agreement, any<br>EFTA State may appeal to the EFTA Court in accordance with<br>Article 108(2) of the EEA Agreement and with the relevant provisions of</p>

That period shall be increased to six weeks if the EFTA Surveillance<br>Authority receives a request from an EFTA State in accordance with Article<br>9(2).</p>
<p>2. Decisions taken pursuant to Article 8(2) concerning notified concentra-<br>tions must be taken as soon as it appears that the serious doubts referred to<br>in Article 6(l)(c) have been removed, particularly as a result of modifica-<br>tions made by the undertakings concerned, and at the latest by the deadline<br>laid down in paragraph 3.</p>
<p>3. Without prejudice to Article 8(6), decisions taken pursuant to<br>Article 8(3) concerning notified concentrations must be taken within not<br>more than four months of the date on which the proceeding is initiated.</p>
<p>4. The period set by paragraph 3 shall exceptionally be suspended where,<br>owing to circumstances for which one of the undertakings involved in the<br>concentration is responsible, the EFTA Surveillance Authority has had to<br>request information by decision pursuant to Article 11 or to order an investi-<br>gation by decision pursuant to Article 13.</p>
<p>5. Where the EFTA Court gives a judgment which annuls the whole or part<br>of an EFTA Surveillance Authority decision taken under this Chapter, the<br>periods laid down in this Chapter shall start again from the date of the judg-<br>ment.</p>
<p>6. Where the EFTA Surveillance Authority has not taken a decision in ac-<br>cordance with Article 6( 1)(b) or (c) or Article 8(2) or (3) within the deadlines<br>set in paragraphs 1 and 3 respectively, the concentration shall be deemed to<br>have been declared compatible with the functioning of the EEA Agreement,<br>without prejudice to Article 9.</p>

<p>Article 1</p>
<p>1. Authorizations pursuant to Article 1(2) of Protocol 25 to the EEA Agree-<br>ment may be granted subject to specified conditions and for limited periods.<br>In such cases the EFTA Surveillance Authority shall renew an authorization<br>once or several times if it finds that the requirements of subparagraphs (a)<br>to (c) of Article 1(2) of Protocol 25 to the EEA Agreement are still met at<br>the time of renewal.</p>
<p>2. The EFTA Surveillance Authority shall revoke or amend an authoriza-<br>tion if it finds that as a result of a change in circumstances the agreement no<br>longer meets these requirements, or that the aetual results of the agreement<br>or of the application thereof are contraiy to the requirements for its author-<br>ization.</p>
<p>3. Decisions granting, renewing, amending, refusing or revoking an author-<br>ization shall be published together with the reasons therefor; the restrictions<br>imposed by Article 3(2) shall not apply thereto.</p>
<p>4. The EFTA Surveillance Authority may, as provided in Article 3, obtain<br>any information needed for the application of Article 1 of Protocol 25 to the<br>EEA Agreement and of this Article, either by making a special request to<br>the parties concerned or by means of decisions stating the kinds of agree-<br>ment, decision or practice which must be communicated to it.</p>
<p>5. The EFTA Surveillance Authority shall have sole jurisdiction, subject to<br>the right to bring actions before the EFTA Court in accordance with<br>Article 108(2) of the EEA Agreement and with the relevant provisions of<br>this Agreement and, on the conditions set out in Article 55 of the EEA<br>Agreement and Protocols 22 and 25 thereto, to rule whether any such agree-<br>ment or decision is compatible with Article 1 of Protocol 25 to the EEA<br>Agreement.</p>
<p>6. On any undertaking which has entered into an agreement which is auto-<br>matically void pursuant to Article 1(3) of Protocol 25 to the EEA Agree-<br>ment, or has enforced or attempted to enforce, by arbitration, penalty, boy-<br>cott or any other means, an agreement or decision which is automatically<br>void or an agreement for which authorization has been refused or revoked,<br>or has obtained an authorization by means of information which it knew to<br>be false or misleading, or has engaged in practices prohibited by Article 1(1)<br>of Protocol 25 to the EEA Agreement, the EFTA Surveillance Authority<br>may impose fines or periodic penalty payments not exceeding twice the turn-<br>over on the products which were the subject of the agreement, decision or</p>

<p>practice prohibited by Article 1(1) of Protocol 25 to the EEA Agreement;<br>if, however, the purpose of the agreement, decision or practice is to restrict<br>production, technical development or investment, this maximum may be<br>raised to 10% of the annual turnover of the undertakings in question in the<br>case of fines, and 20% of the daily turnover in the case of periodic penalty<br>payments.</p>
<p>Article 2</p>
<p>1. In assessing whether the requirements of Article 2(2) of Protocol 25 to the<br>EEA Agreement are met, the EFTA Surveillance Authority shall, in accord-<br>ance with the principle of non-discrimination, take account of the size of like<br>undertakings in the territory covered by the EEA Agreement, to the extent<br>it considers justified in order to avoid or correct disadvantages resulting from<br>unequal competitive conditions.</p>
<p>2. The EFTA Surveillance Authority may make its authorization subject to<br>any conditions which it considers appropriate for the purposes of Article 2(2)<br>of Protocol 25 to the EEA Agreement.</p>
<p>3. Before ruling on a transaction concerning undertakings at least one of<br>which is not subject to Article 3 of Protocol 25 to the EEA Agreement, the<br>EFTA Surveillance Authority shall obtain the comments of the Govern-<br>ments concerned.</p>
<p>4. Without prejudice to the application of Article 3 to undertakings within<br>its jurisdiction, the EFTA Surveillance Authority may obtain from the nat-<br>ural or legal persons who have acquired or regrouped or are intending to<br>acquire or regroup the rights or assets in question any information needed<br>for the application of Article 2 of Protocol 25 to the EEA Agreement and<br>of the present Article concerning transactions liable to produce the effect<br>referred to in Article 2(1) of Protocol 25 to the EEA Agreement.</p>
<p>5. If a concentration should occur which the EFTA Surveillance Authority<br>finds has been effected contrary to the provisions of Article 2(1) of<br>Protocol 25 to the EEA Agreement but which nevertheless meets the re-<br>quirements of Article 2(2) of Protocol 25 to the EEA Agreement, the EFTA<br>Surveillance Authority shall make its approval of that concentration subject<br>to payment by the persons who have acquired or regrouped the rights or as-<br>sets in question of the fine provided for in paragraph 12(b); the amount of<br>the fine shall not be less than half of the maximum determined in that subpar-<br>agraph (b) should it be clear that authorization ought to have been applied<br>for. If the fine is not paid, the EFTA Surveillance Authority shall take the<br>steps hereinafter provided for in respect of concentrations found to be un-<br>lawful.</p>
<p>6. If a concentration should occur which the EFTA Surveillance Authority<br>finds cannot fulfil the general or specific conditions to which an authorization<br>under Article 2(2) of Protocol 25 to the EEA Agreement would be subject,<br>the EFTA Surveillance Authority shall, by means of a reasoned decision,</p>

Any person directly concerned may institute pro-<br>ceedings against such decisions, as provided in Articles 108(2)(b) of the EEA<br>Agreement and 18 of the present Agreement. The EFTA Court, in accord-<br>ance with Article 108(2) of the EEAAgreement and with the relevant provi-<br>sions of this Agreement, shall have unlimited jurisdiction to assess whether<br>the transaction effected is a concentration within the meaning of Article 2(1)<br>of Protocol 25 to the EEA Agreement and of the acts concerning coal and<br>Steel as contained in Annex XIV to the EEA Agreement. The institution of<br>proceedings shall have suspensory effect. Proceedings may not be instituted<br>until the measures provided for above have been ordered, unless the EFTA<br>Surveillance Authority agrees to the institution of separate proceedings<br>against the decision declaring the transaction unlawful.</p>
<p>7. The EFTA Surveillance Authority may at any time, unless Article 41 of<br>this Agreement is applied, take or cause to be taken such interim measures<br>of protection as it may consider necessary to safeguard the interests of com-<br>peting undertakings and of third parties, and to föreställ any step which<br>might hinder the implementation of its decisions. Unless the EFTA Court<br>decides otherwise, proceedings shall not have suspensory effect in respect of<br>such interim measures.</p>
<p>8. The EFTA Surveillance Authority shall allow the parties concerned a<br>reasonable period in which to comply with its decisions, on expiration of<br>which it may impose daily penalty payments not exceeding one-tenth of 1%<br>of the value of the rights or assets in question.</p>
<p>9. Furthermore, if the parties concerned do not fulfil their obligations, the<br>EFTA Surveillance Authority shall itself take steps to implement its de-<br>cision.</p>
<p>10. The EFTA Surveillance Authority is also empowered to make such re-<br>commendations to the EFTA States concerned as may be necessary to ensure<br>that the measures provided for in the preceding paragraphs are implemented<br>under their own law.</p>
<p>11. In the exercise of its powers, the EFTA Surveillance Authority shall take<br>account of the rights of third parties which have been acquired in good faith.</p>
<p>12. The EFTA Surveillance Authority may impose fines not exceeding:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;3% of the value of the assets acquired or regrouped or to be acquired<br>or regrouped, on natural or legal persons who have evaded the ob-<br>ligations laid down in paragraph 4;</p>

<p>Subject to this reservation, it shall publish such data as could be useful to<br>governments or to any other parties concerned.</p>
<p>3.

The maximum amount of such fines shall be 1% of the annual turnover,<br>and the maximum amount of such penalty payments shall be 5% of the aver-<br>age daily turnover for each day’s delay.</p>
<p>4.
